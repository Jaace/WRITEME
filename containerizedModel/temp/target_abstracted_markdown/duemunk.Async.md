# Async

@abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink 

Now more than syntactic sugar for asynchronous dispatches in Grand Central Dispatch ( @abstr_hyperlink ) in Swift

**Async** sugar looks like this: @abstr_code_section 

So even though GCD has nice-ish syntax as of Swift @abstr_number . @abstr_number , compare the above with: @abstr_code_section 

**AsyncGroup** sugar looks like this: @abstr_code_section 

### Install

#### CocoaPods

@abstr_code_section 

#### Carthage

@abstr_code_section 

### Benefits

@abstr_number . Avoid code indentation by chaining @abstr_number . Arguments and return types reduce polluted scopes

### Things you can do

Supports the modern queue classes: @abstr_code_section 

Chain as many blocks as you want: @abstr_code_section 

Store reference for later chaining: @abstr_code_section 

Custom queues: @abstr_code_section 

Dispatch block after delay: @abstr_code_section 

Cancel blocks that aren't already dispatched: @abstr_code_section 

Wait for block to finish â€“ an ease way to continue on current queue after background task: @abstr_code_section 

### How does it work

The way it work is by using the new notification API for GCD introduced in OS X @abstr_number . @abstr_number and iOS @abstr_number . Each chaining block is called when the previous queue has finished. @abstr_code_section 

The syntax part of the chaining works by having class methods on the `Async` object e.g. `Async.main {}` which returns a struct. The struct has matching methods e.g. `theStruct.main {}`.

### Known bugs

Modern GCD queues don't work as expected in the iOS Simulator. See issues @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink .

### Known improvements

The `dispatch_block_t` can't be extended. Workaround used: Wrap `dispatch_block_t` in a struct that takes the block as a property.

### Apply

There is also a wrapper for @abstr_hyperlink for quick parallelisation of a `for` loop. @abstr_code_section Note that this function returns after the block has been run all @abstr_number times i.e. it is not asynchronous. For asynchronous behaviour, wrap it in a an `Async` block like `Async.background { Apply.background( @abstr_number ) { ... } }`.

### AsyncGroup

**AsyncGroup** facilitates working with groups of asynchronous blocks.

Multiple dispatch blocks with GCD: @abstr_code_section All modern queue classes: @abstr_code_section Custom queues: @abstr_code_section Wait for group to finish: @abstr_code_section Custom asynchronous operations: @abstr_code_section
