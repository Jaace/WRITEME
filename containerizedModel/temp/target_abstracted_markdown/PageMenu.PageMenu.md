The class file required for PageMenu is located in the Classes folder in the root of this repository as listed below:

  * CAPSPageMenu.swift



## How to use PageMenu

First you will have to create a view controller that is supposed to serve as the base of the page menu. This can be a view controller with its xib file as a separate file as well as having its xib file in storyboard. Following this you will have to go through a few simple steps outlined below in order to get everything up and running.

_* @abstr_number ) Add the files listed in the installation section to your project_ *

_* @abstr_number ) Add a property for CAPSPageMenu in your base view controller_ *

Swift

@abstr_code_section 

Objective-C

@abstr_code_section 

_* @abstr_number ) Add the following code in the viewDidLoad function in your view controller_ *

Swift

@abstr_code_section 

Objective-C

@abstr_code_section 

_* @abstr_number ) Optional - Delegate Methods_ *

In order to use the delegate methods first set the delegate of page menu to the parent view controller when setting it up

Swift

@abstr_code_section 

Objective-C

@abstr_code_section 

After that you will be able to set up the following delegate methods inside of your parent view controller

Swift

@abstr_code_section 

Objective-C

@abstr_code_section 

_* @abstr_number ) You should now be ready to use PageMenu!! ðŸŽ‰_ *
