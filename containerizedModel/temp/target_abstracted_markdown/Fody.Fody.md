###  @abstr_image Extensible tool for weaving .net assemblies

Manipulating the IL of an assembly as part of a build requires a significant amount of plumbing code. This plumbing code involves knowledge of both the MSBuild and Visual Studio APIs. Fody attempts to eliminate that plumbing code through an extensible add-in model.

**This is the codebase of core Fody engine. For more information on the larger Fody project see https://github.com/Fody/Home.**
