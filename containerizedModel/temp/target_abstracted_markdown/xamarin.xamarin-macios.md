# Xamarin.iOS & Xamarin.Mac

## Welcome!

This module is the main repository for both **Xamarin.iOS** and **Xamarin.Mac**.

These SDKs allow us to create native iOS, tvOS, watchOS and macOS applications using the same UI controls we would in Objective-C and Xcode, except with the flexibility and elegance of a modern language (C#), the power of the .NET Base Class Library (BCL), and two first-class IDEs—Visual Studio for Mac and Visual Studio—at our fingertips.

This repository is where we do development for the Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Mac SDKs. There are a few ways that you can contribute, for example:

  * @abstr_hyperlink 
  * @abstr_hyperlink 
  * @abstr_hyperlink to resolve issues and fix bugs
