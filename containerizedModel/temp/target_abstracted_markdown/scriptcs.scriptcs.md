## What is it?

scriptcs makes it easy to write and execute C# with a simple text editor.

While Visual Studio, and other IDEs, are powerful tools, they can sometimes hinder productivity more than they promote it. You donâ€™t always need, or want, the overhead of a creating a new solution or project. Sometimes you want to just type away in your favorite text editor.

scriptcs frees you from Visual Studio, without sacrificing the advantages of a strongly-typed language. 

  * Write C# in your favorite text editor.
  * Use NuGet to manage your dependencies.
  * The relaxed C# scripting syntax means you can write and execute an application with only one line of code. 
  * Script Packs allow you to bootstrap the environment for new scripts, further reduces the amount of code necessary to take advantage of your favorite C# frameworks.



## Getting scriptcs

Releases and nightly builds should be installed using @abstr_hyperlink . To install Chocolatey, execute the following command in your command prompt:
    
    
    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps @abstr_number '))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\chocolatey\bin
    

If the above fails with the error indicating that proxy authentication is required (i.e. @abstr_hyperlink ) then try again with the following on the command prompt that uses your default credentials:
    
    
    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "[Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy.Credentials = [Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials; iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps @abstr_number '))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\chocolatey\bin
    

**Note:** If you are using a version of Chocolatey  > @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number you can pass the `-y` into the install and upgrade commands to prevent the confirmation that will appear.

### Installing scriptcs

Once Chocolatey has been installed, you can install the latest stable version of scriptcs from your command prompt:
    
    
    choco install scriptcs
    

Chocolatey will install scriptcs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\scriptcs\` and update your PATH accordingly.

**Note:** You may need to restart your command prompt after the installation completes.

### Staying up-to-date

With Chocolatey, keeping scriptcs updated is just as easy:
    
    
    choco upgrade scriptcs
    

**Note:** If you are using a version of Chocolatey  < @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number you will need to use `choco update scriptcs`, but also think about updating Chocolatey itself.

### Nightly builds

Nightly builds are hosted on @abstr_hyperlink , and can also be installed through with Chocolatey:
    
    
    choco install scriptcs -pre -source https://www.myget.org/F/scriptcsnightly/
    

### Building from source

#### Windows

@abstr_number . Ensure you have .NET Framework @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number installed.

@abstr_number . Execute the build script.
    
    
    `build.cmd`
    

#### Linux

@abstr_number . Ensure you have @abstr_hyperlink or later installed.

@abstr_number . Execute the build script
    
    
    `./build.sh`
    

## Getting Started

### Using the REPL

The scriptcs REPL can be started by running scriptcs without any parameters. The REPL allows you to execute C# statements directly from your command prompt.

@abstr_code_section 

REPL supports all C# language constructs (i.e. class definition, method definition), as well as multi-line input. For example:

@abstr_code_section 

### Writing a script

  * In an empty directory, create a new file named `app.csx`:



```c# using Raven.Client; using Raven.Client.Embedded; using Raven.Client.Indexes;

Console.WriteLine("Starting RavenDB server...");

using (var documentStore = new EmbeddableDocumentStore { UseEmbeddedHttpServer = true }) { documentStore.Initialize(); Console.WriteLine($"RavenDB started, listening on http://localhost:{documentStore.Configuration.Port}"); Console.ReadKey(); } @abstr_code_section batchfile scriptcs -install RavenDB.Embedded @abstr_code_section batchfile

> scriptcs app.csx INFO : Starting to create execution components INFO : Starting execution Starting RavenDB server... .. snip .. RavenDB started, listening on http://localhost: @abstr_number . @abstr_code_section batchfile scriptcs -install ScriptCs.WebApi @abstr_code_section c# public class TestController : ApiController { public string Get() { return "Hello world!"; } }

var webApi = Require(); var server = webApi.CreateServer("http://localhost: @abstr_number "); server.OpenAsync().Wait();

Console.WriteLine("Listening..."); Console.ReadKey(); server.CloseAsync().Wait(); @abstr_code_section batchfile scriptcs server.csx @abstr_code_section xml Hello world! @abstr_code_section c#

# load "controller.csx"

@abstr_code_section batchfile scriptcs server.csx @abstr_code_section xml Hello world! @abstr_code_section c#

# r "nunit.core.dll"

# r "nunit.core.interfaces.dll"

var path = "UnitTests.dll"; var runner = TestSetup.GetRunner(new[] {path}); var result = runner.Run(new ConsoleListener(msg => Console.WriteLine(msg)), TestFilter.Empty, true, LoggingThreshold.All);

Console.ReadKey(); ```

### Debugging

Instructions for debugging scripts using Visual Studio can be found on the @abstr_hyperlink .

### Package installation

You can install any NuGet packages directly from the scriptcs CLI. This will pull the relevant packages from NuGet, and install them in the scriptcs_packages folder.

Once the packages are installed, you can simply start using them in your script code directly (just import the namespaces - no additional bootstrapping or DLL referencing is needed).

The `install` command will also create a `scriptcs_packages.config` file if you don't have one - so that you can easily redistribute your script (without having to copy the package binaries).

  * `scriptcs -install {package name}` will install the desired package from NuGet. 

For example: 
    
        scriptcs -install ServiceStack
    

  * `scriptcs -install` (without package name) will look for the `scriptcs_packages.config` file located in the current execution directory, and install all the packages specified there. You only need to specify **top level** packages.




For example, you might create the following `scriptcs_packages.config`:
    
    
    <?xml version=" @abstr_number . @abstr_number " encoding="utf- @abstr_number "?>
    <packages>
        <package id="Nancy.Hosting.Self" version=" @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number " targetFramework="net @abstr_number " />
        <package id="Nancy.Bootstrappers.Autofac" version=" @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number " targetFramework="net @abstr_number " />
        <package id="Autofac" version=" @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number " targetFramework="net @abstr_number " />
    </packages>
    

And then just call:
    
    
    scriptcs -install
    

As a result, all packages specified in the `scriptcs_packages.config`, including all dependencies, will be downloaded and installed in the `scriptcs_packages` folder.
