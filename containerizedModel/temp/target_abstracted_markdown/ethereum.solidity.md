## Background

Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer network where nobody has special authority over the execution and thus they allow to implement tokens of value, ownership, voting and other kinds of logics.

When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity. This is because breaking changes as well as new features and bug fixes are introduced regularly. We currently use a @abstr_number .x version number @abstr_hyperlink .

## Build and Install

Instructions about how to build and install the Solidity compiler can be found in the @abstr_hyperlink 

## Example

A "Hello World" program in Solidity is of even less use than in other languages, but still:

@abstr_code_section 

To get started with Solidity, you can use @abstr_hyperlink , which is an browser-based IDE. Here are some example contracts:

@abstr_number . @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_number . @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_number . @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_number . @abstr_hyperlink 

## Documentation

The Solidity documentation is hosted at @abstr_hyperlink .

## Development

Solidity is still under development. Contributions are always welcome! Please follow the @abstr_hyperlink if you want to help.
