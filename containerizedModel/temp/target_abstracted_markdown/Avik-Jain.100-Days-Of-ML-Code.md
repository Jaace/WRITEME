## Logistic Regression | Day @abstr_number

Moving forward into # @abstr_number DaysOfMLCode today I dived into the deeper depth of what Logistic Regression actually is and what is the math involved behind it. Learned how cost function is calculated and then how to apply gradient descent algorithm to cost function to minimize the error in prediction.   
Due to less time I will now be posting an infographic on alternate days. Also if someone wants to help me out in documentaion of code and already has some experince in the field and knows Markdown for github please contact me on LinkedIn :) .
