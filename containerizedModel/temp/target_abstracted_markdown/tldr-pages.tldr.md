Maybe it doesn't help that the first option explained in `man tar` is:

@abstr_code_section 

Surely people could benefit from simplified man pages focused on practical examples. How about:

## What does "tldr" mean?

TL;DR stands for "Too Long; Didn't Read". It originates in Internet slang, where it is used to indicate that a long text (or parts of it) has been skipped as too lengthy. Read more in Wikipedia's @abstr_hyperlink .
