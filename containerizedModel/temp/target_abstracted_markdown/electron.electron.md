## Installation

To install prebuilt Electron binaries, use @abstr_hyperlink . The preferred method is to install Electron as a development dependency in your app:

@abstr_code_section 

The `--save-exact` flag is recommended for Electron prior to version @abstr_number , as it does not follow semantic versioning. As of version @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number , Electron follows semver, so you don't need `--save-exact` flag. For info on how to manage Electron versions in your apps, see Electron versioning.

For more installation options and troubleshooting tips, see installation.

## Quick start & Electron Fiddle

Use @abstr_hyperlink to build, run, and package small Electron experiments, to see code examples for all of Electron's APIs, and to try out different versions of Electron. It's designed to make the start of your journey with Electron easier.

Alternatively, clone and run the @abstr_hyperlink repository to see a minimal Electron app in action:

## Programmatic usage

Most people use Electron from the command line, but if you require `electron` inside your **Node app** (not your Electron app) it will return the file path to the binary. Use this to spawn Electron from Node scripts:
