## Overview

  * **Freedom to build what you want** FreeCAD is an open-source parametric @abstr_number D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size. Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify your design by going back into your model history and changing its parameters. 

  * **Create @abstr_number D from @abstr_number D & back** FreeCAD allows you to sketch geometry constrained @abstr_number D shapes and use them as a base to build other objects. It contains many components to adjust dimensions or extract design details from @abstr_number D models to create high quality production ready drawings.

  * **Designed for your needs** FreeCAD is designed to fit a wide range of uses including product design, mechanical engineering and architecture. Whether you are a hobbyist, a programmer, an experienced CAD user, a student or a teacher, you will feel right at home with FreeCAD.

  * **Cross platform** FreeCAD runs on Windows, Mac and Linux

  * **Underlying technology**

    * **OpenCASCADE** A powerful geometry kernel, the most important component of FreeCAD
    * **Coin @abstr_number D library** Open Inventor-compliant @abstr_number D scene representation model
    * **Python** FreeCAD offers a broad Python API
    * **Qt** Graphical User Interface built with Qt



## Installing

Precompiled (installable) packages are available for Windows and Mac on the @abstr_hyperlink .

On most Linux distributions, FreeCAD is directly installable from the software center application.

Other options are described at the @abstr_hyperlink .

## Compiling

Compiling FreeCAD requires installation of several libraries and their development files such as OpenCASCADe, Coin and Qt, listed in the pages below. Once this is done, FreeCAD can be simply compiled with cMake. On Windows, these libraries are bundled and offered by the FreeCAD team in a convenient package. On Linux, they are usually found in your distribution's repositories, and on Mac OSX and other platforms you will usually need to compile them yourself.

The pages below contain up-to-date build instructions:
