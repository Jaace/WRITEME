Auto-Keras is an open source software library for automated machine learning (AutoML). It is developed by @abstr_hyperlink at Texas A&M University and community contributors. The ultimate goal of AutoML is to provide easily accessible deep learning tools to domain experts with limited data science or machine learning background. Auto-Keras provides functions to automatically search for architecture and hyperparameters of deep learning models.

## Example

Here is a short example of using the package.
