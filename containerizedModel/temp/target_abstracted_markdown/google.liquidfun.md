# Welcome to LiquidFun!

LiquidFun is a @abstr_number D physics engine for games. Go to our @abstr_hyperlink to browse our documentation and see some examples.

LiquidFun is an extension of @abstr_hyperlink . It adds a particle based fluid and soft body simulation to the rigid body functionality of @abstr_hyperlink . LiquidFun can be built for many different systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, OS X, Linux, and JavaScript. Please see `Box @abstr_number D/Documentation/Building/` for details.

Discuss LiquidFun with other developers and users on the @abstr_hyperlink . File issues on the @abstr_hyperlink or post your questions to @abstr_hyperlink with a mention of **liquidfun**.

Please see @abstr_hyperlink to learn how to build LiquidFun and run the testbed.

LiquidFun has a logo that you can use, in your splash screens or documentation, for example. Please see the @abstr_hyperlink for the graphics and further details.

For applications on Google Play that integrate this tool, usage is tracked. This tracking is done automatically using the embedded version string (`b @abstr_number _liquidFunVersionString`), and helps us continue to optimize it. Aside from consuming a few extra bytes in your application binary, it shouldn't affect your application at all. We use this information to let us know if LiquidFun is useful and if we should continue to invest in it. Since this is open source, you are free to remove the version string but we would appreciate if you would leave it in.
