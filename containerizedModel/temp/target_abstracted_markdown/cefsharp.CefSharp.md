@abstr_hyperlink lets you embed Chromium in .NET apps. It is a lightweight .NET wrapper around the @abstr_hyperlink by Marshall A. Greenblatt. About @abstr_number % of the bindings are written in C++/CLI with the majority of code here is C#. It can be used from C# or VB, or any other CLR language. CefSharp provides both WPF and WinForms web browser control implementations.

CefSharp is @abstr_hyperlink licensed, so it can be used in both proprietary and free/open source applications. For the full details, see the LICENSE file. 

If you like and use CefSharp please consider signing up for a small monthly donation, even $ @abstr_number can help tremendously. See Financial Support for more details.

## Branches & Forks

This is the `official` CefSharp fork, as maintained by the CefSharp community. You can also view @abstr_hyperlink .

Development is done in the `master` branch. New features are preferably added in feature branches, if the changes are more than trivial. New `PR's` should be targeted against `master`.

When a new release is imminent a `release` branch is created. We try to avoid making public facing `API` changes in `release` branches (Adding new features is fine, just not breaking changes).

### Releases

**CI Builds**  
Every commit on `master` produces a `Nuget` package. Use at your own risk!

### Release Branches

With each release a new branch is created, for example the `@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number` release corresponds to the `cefsharp/ @abstr_number` branch. If you're new to `CefSharp` and are downloading the source to check it out, please use a **Release** branch

## Financial Support

To continue developing/supporting the project I (@amaitland) am asking for financial contributions. Donations of any size are greatly appreciated!

`@abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number` Release: @abstr_hyperlink 

Recurring contributions can be made through @abstr_hyperlink or one time contributions through @abstr_hyperlink 

Now that I (@amaitland) am a stay at home dad your contributions are the only reason I'm allowed to continue working on the project. Without continued funding the time I currently spend on the project will have to be put into finding other paid work.
