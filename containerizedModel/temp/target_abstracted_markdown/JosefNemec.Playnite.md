### Code Contributions

Please ask in the related issue first before starting implementing something to make sure that nobody else is already working on it. If an issue doesn't exist for your feature/bug fix, create one first.

Regarding code styling, there are only a few major rules:

  * private fields and properties should use camelCase (without underscore)
  * all methods (private and public) should use PascalCase
  * use spaces instead of tabs with @abstr_number spaces width
  * always encapsulate the code body after _if, for, foreach, while_ etc. with curly braces:

@abstr_code_section 




instead of

@abstr_code_section
