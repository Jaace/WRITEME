## Background

One of the few features I missed from macOS is @abstr_hyperlink . It allows user peek into a file content in lightning speed by just pressing the `Space` key. Windows, on the other hand, does not have this handy feature ... until now.

I am aware that several alternatives are already available on the Internet (e.g. @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink ). Despite these options, I still decided to craft another one by myself, because they are either not being actively developed, lack of variety, or ask for an amount of $$$.

## Highlights

  * Tons of supported file types (full list @abstr_hyperlink )
  * Fluent design (new in version @abstr_number . @abstr_number )
  * Touchscreen friendly
  * HiDPI support
  * Preview from _Open_ and _Save File_ Dialog
  * Preview from @abstr_number rd-party file managers (see a list @abstr_hyperlink )
  * Easily extended by @abstr_hyperlink 
  * Strict GPL license to keep it free forever

Preview next file by clicking on it or using arrow-keys (arrow-keys move selection in the background if the preview window is not in focus) @abstr_number .
