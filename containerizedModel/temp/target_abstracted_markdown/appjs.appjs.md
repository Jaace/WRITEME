# Attention

AppJS project has not been actively developed for several months. However ownership of the project has now changed and the future is being discussed.

An offshoot project @abstr_hyperlink has been very actively developed. It is a javascript based SDK for building applications that uses an off the shelf nodejs and chromium to build html @abstr_number / css / js applications.

The future will probably involve appjs being able to be run stand alone or as a frontend to deskshell. Please contribute to the discussions on our mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/appjs-dev

# AppJS

AppJS is an SDK to develop desktop applications using Node.js melded with Chromium. With AppJS you can develop desktop tools and applications using the same libraries and knowledge used to build websites. You get all the following in one package:

  * JS, HTML @abstr_number , CSS, SVG, WebGL provided by Chromium
  * mature http/https servers and client APIs - Node
  * filesystem, dns, cryptography, subprocesses, OS APIs - Node
  * sandboxed code execution environments virtual machines - Node
  * tools for exposing native C++ bindings to JavaScript- Node

__npm install__ _OS X install is currently broken_

AppJS can be now be installed via npm.
    
    
    npm install appjs
    

__AppJS requires @abstr_number bit Node on OS X__. It works on @abstr_number bit OS X but __Node must be @abstr_number bit__. We're working on solving this, but it's a limitation of Chrome itself so it's a work in progress. Help us gain traction by @abstr_hyperlink .

(Windows requires @abstr_hyperlink )
