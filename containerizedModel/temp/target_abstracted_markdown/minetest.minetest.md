## Paths

Locations:

  * `bin` \- Compiled binaries
  * `share` \- Distributed read-only data
  * `user` \- User-created modifiable data



Where each location is on each platform:

  * Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source: 
    * `bin` = `bin`
    * `share` = `.`
    * `user` = `.`
  * Windows installed: 
    * `bin` = `C:\Program Files\Minetest\bin (Depends on the install location)`
    * `share` = `C:\Program Files\Minetest (Depends on the install location)`
    * `user` = `%APPDATA%\Minetest`
  * Linux installed: 
    * `bin` = `/usr/bin`
    * `share` = `/usr/share/minetest`
    * `user` = `~/.minetest`
  * macOS: 
    * `bin` = `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share` = `Contents/Resources`
    * `user` = `Contents/User OR ~/Library/Application Support/minetest`



Worlds can be found as separate folders in: `user/worlds/`

## Configuration file

  * Default location: `user/minetest.conf`
  * This file is created by closing Minetest for the first time.
  * A specific file can be specified on the command line: `--config <path-to-file>`
  * A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in `location_of_exe/../minetest.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../minetest.conf`



## Command-line options

  * Use `--help`

#### Download

You can install Git for easily keeping your copy up to date. If you donâ€™t want Git, read below on how to get the source without Git. This is an example for installing Git on Debian/Ubuntu:
    
    
    sudo apt install git
    

For Fedora users:
    
    
    sudo dnf install git
    

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using Git:
    
    
    git clone --depth  @abstr_number  https://github.com/minetest/minetest.git
    cd minetest
    

Download minetest_game (otherwise only the "Minimal development test" game is available) using Git:
    
    
    git clone --depth  @abstr_number  https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game.git games/minetest_game
    

Download source, without using Git:
    
    
    wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    cd minetest-master
    

Download minetest_game, without using Git:
    
    
    cd games/
    wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    mv minetest_game-master minetest_game
    cd ..
    

#### Build

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:
    
    
    cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=TRUE
    make -j <number of processors>
    

Run it:
    
    
    ./bin/minetest
    

  * Use `cmake . -LH` to see all CMake options and their current state.
  * If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package), you will want to use `-DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE`.
  * You can build a bare server by specifying `-DBUILD_SERVER=TRUE`.
  * You can disable the client build by specifying `-DBUILD_CLIENT=FALSE`.
  * You can select between Release and Debug build by `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>`. 
    * Debug build is slower, but gives much more useful output in a debugger.
  * If you build a bare server you don't need to have Irrlicht installed. 
    * In that case use `-DIRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR=/the/irrlicht/source`.

### Compiling on Windows

### Requirements

  * @abstr_hyperlink 
  * @abstr_hyperlink 
  * @abstr_hyperlink 
  * @abstr_hyperlink 



### Compiling and installing the dependencies

It is highly recommended to use vcpkg as package manager.

#### a) Using vcpkg to install dependencies

After you successfully built vcpkg you can easily install the required libraries: @abstr_code_section 

  * `curl` is optional, but required to read the serverlist, `curl[winssl]` is required to use the content store.
  * `openal-soft`, `libvorbis` and `libogg` are optional, but required to use sound.
  * `freetype` is optional, it allows true-type font rendering.
  * `luajit` is optional, it replaces the integrated Lua interpreter with a faster just-in-time interpreter.



There are other optional libraries, but they are not tested if they can build and link correctly.

Use `--triplet` to specify the target triplet, e.g. `x @abstr_number -windows` or `x @abstr_number -windows`.

#### b) Compile the dependencies on your own

This is outdated and not recommended. Follow the instructions on https://dev.minetest.net/Build_Win @abstr_number _Minetest_including_all_required_libraries#VS @abstr_number _Build

### Compile Minetest

#### a) Using the vcpkg toolchain and CMake GUI

@abstr_number . Start up the CMake GUI @abstr_number . Select **Browse Source...** and select DIR/minetest @abstr_number . Select **Browse Build...** and select DIR/minetest-build @abstr_number . Select **Configure** @abstr_number . Choose the right visual Studio version and target platform. It has to match the version of the installed dependencies @abstr_number . Choose **Specify toolchain file for cross-compiling** @abstr_number . Click **Next** @abstr_number . Select the vcpkg toolchain file e.g. `D:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` @abstr_number . Click Finish @abstr_number . Wait until cmake have generated the cash file @abstr_number . If there are any errors, solve them and hit **Configure** @abstr_number . Click **Generate** @abstr_number . Click **Open Project** @abstr_number . Compile Minetest inside Visual studio.

#### b) Using the vcpkg toolchain and the commandline

Run the following script in PowerShell:

@abstr_code_section Make sure that the right compiler is selected and the path to the vcpkg toolchain is correct.

#### c) Using your own compiled libraries

**This is outdated and not recommended**

Follow the instructions on https://dev.minetest.net/Build_Win @abstr_number _Minetest_including_all_required_libraries#VS @abstr_number _Build

### Windows Installer using WiX Toolset

Requirements: * @abstr_hyperlink * @abstr_hyperlink 

In the Visual Studio @abstr_number Installer select **Optional Features - > WiX Toolset**.

Build the binaries as described above, but make sure you unselect `RUN_IN_PLACE`.

Open the generated project file with Visual Studio. Right-click **Package** and choose **Generate**. It may take some minutes to generate the installer.

## Docker

We provide Minetest server Docker images using the GitLab mirror registry.

Images are built on each commit and available using the following tag scheme:

  * `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:latest` (latest build)
  * `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<branch/tag>` (current branch or current tag)
  * `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<commit-id>` (current commit id)



If you want to test it on a Docker server you can easily run:
    
    
    sudo docker run registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<docker tag>
    

If you want to use it in a production environment you should use volumes bound to the Docker host to persist data and modify the configuration:
    
    
    sudo docker create -v /home/minetest/data/:/var/lib/minetest/ -v /home/minetest/conf/:/etc/minetest/ registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:master
    

Data will be written to `/home/minetest/data` on the host, and configuration will be read from `/home/minetest/conf/minetest.conf`.

**Note:** If you don't understand the previous commands please read the official Docker documentation before use.

You can also host your Minetest server inside a Kubernetes cluster. See our example implementation in misc/kubernetes.yml.

## Version scheme

We use `major.minor.patch` since @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number -dev. Prior to that we used `@abstr_number .major.minor`.

  * Major is incremented when the release contains breaking changes, all other numbers are set to @abstr_number .
  * Minor is incremented when the release contains new non-breaking features, patch is set to @abstr_number .
  * Patch is incremented when the release only contains bugfixes and very minor/trivial features considered necessary.



Since @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number -dev and @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number -dev, the dev notation refers to the next release, i.e.: @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number -dev is the development version leading to @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . Prior to that we used `previous_version-dev`.
