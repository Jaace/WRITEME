## Introduction

  * GuiLite is the smallest GUI library with @abstr_number lines of C++ code, it runs on **all platforms** (e.g, iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, macOS, Docker and **MCU with or without OS** ).
  * GuiLite is embeddable, it runs inside other UI frameworks(e.g, Qt, MFC, Winform, Cocoa). You could use GuiLite features and host UI features simultaneously.
  * GuiLite render UI by itself, independent of OS & Graphic library.
  * GuiLite could work with many languages(e.g. Swift, Java, C#, Golang).
  * 🔧We want people to customize GuiLite.
  * ⚙️We hope GuiLite is small enough to help you understand how UI works.
  * 👑You should be the master of your UI and not be tied to a specific framework.



## 🔥New feature： @abstr_number D

@abstr_image @abstr_image 

Hello @abstr_number D has only @abstr_hyperlink for beginner, showing you how to build pseudo @abstr_number D App with GuiLite. You can run it on Windows, Linux and MCU.

## Features

### Cross platform

| ARM Linux | STM @abstr_number Without OS | | --- | --- | | @abstr_image | @abstr_image @abstr_image |

## Start with Demo

GuiLite is only a framework, could not create UI by itself. In order to show how to build UI App with it, We provide some samples for you. \- Sample code @abstr_hyperlink . \- Sample introduction:
