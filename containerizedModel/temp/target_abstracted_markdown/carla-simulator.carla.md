CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions.

## Building CARLA

Use `git clone` or download the project from this page. Note that the master branch contains the latest fixes and features, for the latest stable code may be best to switch to the `stable` branch.

Then follow the instruction at @abstr_hyperlink or @abstr_hyperlink .

Unfortunately we don't have official instructions to build on Mac yet, please check the progress at @abstr_hyperlink .
