# yuzu emulator

@abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink 

yuzu is an experimental open-source emulator for the Nintendo Switch from the creators of @abstr_hyperlink .

It is written in C++ with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows, Linux and macOS. The emulator is currently only useful for homebrew development and research purposes.

yuzu only emulates a subset of Switch hardware and therefore is generally only useful for running/debugging homebrew applications. yuzu can boot some games, to varying degrees of success.

yuzu is licensed under the GPLv @abstr_number (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included.
