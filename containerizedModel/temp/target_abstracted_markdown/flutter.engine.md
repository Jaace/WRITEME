# Flutter Engine

@abstr_hyperlink 

Flutter is Google's mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

The Flutter Engine is a portable runtime for hosting @abstr_hyperlink applications. It implements Flutter's core libraries, including animation and graphics, file and network I/O, accessibility support, plugin architecture, and a Dart runtime and compile toolchain. Most developers will interact with Flutter via the @abstr_hyperlink , which provides a modern, reactive framework, and a rich set of platform, layout and foundation widgets.

If you are new to Flutter, then you will find more general information on the Flutter project, including tutorials and samples, on our Web site at @abstr_hyperlink . For specific information about Flutter's APIs, consider our API reference which can be found at the @abstr_hyperlink .
