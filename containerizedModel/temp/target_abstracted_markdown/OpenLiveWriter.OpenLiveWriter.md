### History

The product that became Live Writer was originally created by a small, super-talented team of engineers including JJ Allaire, Joe Cheng, Charles Teague, and Spike Washburn. The team was acquired by Microsoft in @abstr_number and organized with the Spaces team. Becky Pezely joined the team and over time, the team grew and shipped many popular releases of Windows Live Writer.

As Microsoft was planning for the version of Windows Live that would coincide with Windows @abstr_number operating system release, the teams that built the Windows Live client apps for Windows were encouraged to focus on building a smaller set of Windows @abstr_number apps designed to work well with both traditional PC input mechanisms and touch. With the rise of micro-blogging platforms and other forms of sharing, eventually this team decided to conclude their work on Windows Live Writer with Windows Live Writer @abstr_number .

Even though there was no active development, Windows Live Writer continued to be a favorite tool of a passionate community of Windows PC users for authoring, editing, and publishing blog posts. Data from WordPress.com at the time suggested that Windows Live Writer (even two years after active development ended) was the # @abstr_number app for authoring a blog post to WordPress.com from a Windows PC. 

A few employees at Microsoft took an interest in reviving Live Writer as an open source project in their spare time. By January @abstr_number , a group of about a half-dozen engineers interested in spending some of their volunteer time to help release an updated version of Live Writer had found each other and began work on getting this open source fork of Live Writer formed and ready to ship. In December @abstr_number Microsoft donated the code to the .NET Foundation and this passionate group of volunteer engineers rapidly assembled the first open source version.

### Building

Open Live Writer can be built by running build.cmd found in this directory.   
It can be opened in Visual Studio. The solution is in src/managed/writer.sln -- if you see errors in Visual Studio run build.cmd from the command prompt and it should be resolved. The main program is src/managed/OpenLiveWriter/ApplicationMain.cs . To run from Visual Studio, set the startup project to OpenLiveWriter.

### .NET Foundation

The Open Live Writer project is supported by the @abstr_hyperlink .
