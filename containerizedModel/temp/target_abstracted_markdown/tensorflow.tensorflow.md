**TensorFlow** is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. The graph nodes represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. This flexible architecture enables you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting code. TensorFlow also includes @abstr_hyperlink , a data visualization toolkit.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research. The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.

TensorFlow provides stable Python and C APIs as well as non-guaranteed backwards compatible API's for C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Swift.

_See @abstr_hyperlink for detailed instructions, and how to build from source._

People who are a little more adventurous can also try our nightly binaries:

**Nightly pip packages** * We are pleased to announce that TensorFlow now offers nightly pip packages under the @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink project on PyPi. Simply run `pip install tf-nightly` or `pip install tf-nightly-gpu` in a clean environment to install the nightly TensorFlow build. We support CPU and GPU packages on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
