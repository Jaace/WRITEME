If you're on Ubuntu, read the specific guide on @abstr_hyperlink . If you're on a Raspberry Pi, read the @abstr_hyperlink guide instead.

You can put in your account details now by passing the username and password parameters to the `InstaPy()` function in your **quickstart** script, like so: @abstr_code_section Or you can pass them using the Command Line Interface (CLI).

> If you've used _InstaPy_ before installing it by **pip** , you have to move your _old_ data to the new **workspace** folder for once. Read how to do this here.

To run InstaPy, you'll need to run the **@abstr_hyperlink** script you've just downloaded.

@abstr_code_section 

InstaPy will now open a browser window and start working.

> If want InstaPy to run in the background pass the `--headless-browser` option when running from the CLI   
>  Or add the `headless_browser=True` parameter to the `InstaPy(headless_browser=True)` constructor.
