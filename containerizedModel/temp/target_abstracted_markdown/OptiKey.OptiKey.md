# OptiKey

OptiKey is an on-screen keyboard that is designed to help Motor Neuron Disease (MND) patients interact with Windows computers. When used with an eye-tracking device, OptiKey's on-screen keyboard allows MND patients to complete tasks, such as email composition, using only their eyes. OptiKey can also be used with a mouse or webcam. Unlike expensive and unreliable Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) products that are difficult to use, Optikey is free, reliable, and easy to use.
