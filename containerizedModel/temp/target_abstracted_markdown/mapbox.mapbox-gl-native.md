# Mapbox GL Native

A library for embedding interactive, customizable vector maps into native applications on multiple platforms. It takes stylesheets that conform to the @abstr_hyperlink , applies them to vector tiles that conform to the @abstr_hyperlink , and renders them using OpenGL. @abstr_hyperlink is the WebGL-based counterpart, designed for use on the Web.

## The Mapbox GL ecosystem

This repository hosts the cross-platform Mapbox GL Native library, plus convenient SDKs for several platforms. The cross-platform library comes with a @abstr_hyperlink -based demo application for Ubuntu Linux and macOS. The SDKs target the usual languages on their respective platforms:

| SDK | Languages | Build status | | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | | Mapbox GL Native | C++ @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink | | Mapbox Maps SDK for Android | Java | @abstr_hyperlink | | Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS | Objective-C or Swift | @abstr_hyperlink | | Mapbox Maps SDK for macOS | Objective-C, Swift, or AppleScript | @abstr_hyperlink | | node-mapbox-gl-native | Node.js | @abstr_hyperlink | | Mapbox Maps SDK for Qt | C++ @abstr_number | @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink |

@abstr_hyperlink for **hybrid applications** are developed outside of this repository. If your platform or hybrid application framework isnâ€™t listed there, consider embedding @abstr_hyperlink using the standard Web capabilities on your platform.
