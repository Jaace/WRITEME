P is a language for asynchronous event-driven programming. P allows the programmer to specify the system as a collection of interacting state machines, which communicate with each other using events. P unifies modeling and programming into one activity for the programmer. Not only can a P program be compiled into executable code, but it can also be validated using systematic testing. P has been used to implement and validate the USB device driver stack that ships with Microsoft Windows @abstr_number and Windows Phone. P is also suitable for the design and implementation of networked, embedded, and distributed systems.

# Manual

Check the @abstr_hyperlink .

Information for building P framework is available @abstr_hyperlink .

# Demos

See @abstr_hyperlink using P to control a quadrocopter and make sense of the MavLink stream, all visualized in a live DGML diagram.

# Application to Robotics

We built DRONA, a software framework for distributed mobile robotics systems. DRONA uses P language for implementing and model-checking the distributed robotics software stack ( **@abstr_hyperlink** ). The C code generated from P compiler can be easily deployed on Robot Operating System (ROS). More details about the DRONA framework and simulation videos are available here: **@abstr_hyperlink**

We are working on using the DRONA framework for building real-world drone applications using **@abstr_hyperlink** and extending DRONA with runtime monitoring capabilities for reliability. Details about these extensions will be posted soon.
