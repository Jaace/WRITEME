  * **Tracks** : 
    * Cards left in your deck or cards drawn from your deck.
    * Your handcount, deckcount and draw chances.
    * Cards played by your opponent.
    * Your opponent's handcount, deckcount and probablities of him having/drawing cards.
    * How long your opponent had each card in his hand and what cards have been mulliganed, stolen or returned. 
  * **Timer** for the current turn and total time spent for you and your opponent. 
  * The tracker tries to **automatically select the deck you are playing**. 
  * The cards and timer can either be displayed in an overlay (see screenshot) or in **extra windows** (Options  > General > Additional Windows) 
  * **Deck Manager** : 
    * **Import** decks from websites: arenavalue, hearthstats, hearthpwn, hearthhead, hearthstoneplayers, tempostorm, hearthstonetopdeck and hearthnews 
    * Circumvent the @abstr_number deck limit: Saved decks can be **exported to Hearthstone**. (My Decks  > More...)
    * Decks can be filtered by custom **tags** and sorted by name, date and tags. 
    * Set **notes** for each deck (My Decks  > More...) 
    * Create **screenshots** of decks (My Decks  > More...) 
    * **Share** your decks by exporting them as xml files or id-strings (My Decks  > More...). Both can be imported via New Deck > Import. 
  * **Notifications** : get notified when a game or a turn starts (either by the tray icon flashing or hearthstone popping up) 
  * **Customization** : Almost every feature can be turned on/off separately.
  * **Extensible via plugins** : @abstr_hyperlink 
  * **Stats per deck** : 
    * Track the result of each game (win/loss), opponents, game mode and more
    * Win/loss rate vs each class.
    * Details for each game (cards drawn, played, etc.).
    * Select which game modes to track (Options > Other). 
    * Import your opponent's (partial) deck from a tracked game as a new deck.
