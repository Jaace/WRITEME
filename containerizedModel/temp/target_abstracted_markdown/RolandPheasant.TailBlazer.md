In my day to day professional life I am always tailing log files but have always been disappointed with the utilities on offer. The current crop of free ones all look like they were written in the @abstr_number s, are very ugly and have limited functionality.

So I have decided to rectify this by creating a more modern version. The mission statement is: 

> It has to be fast, intuitive, functionally rich and the code has to be @abstr_number % reactive.

After several months of sacrificing my free time, Tail Blazer is finally begining to have a polished feel to it:

And I believe now that it is begining to look good.

## Very large files and fast scrolling

Tail Blazer can easily handle a file of any size. The largest file I have tested was @abstr_number Gb which was the maximum file size I could create before my disk would become full.

## Roll call of honour

For me to produce this application I have used several community led open source projects all of which I love. So if you like this app I recommend checking out the following.

  * @abstr_hyperlink Rx based collections developed by me.
  * @abstr_hyperlink by my friend and work colleage ButchersBoy. This brings WPF into the @abstr_number st century.
  * @abstr_hyperlink also by ButchersBoy. I think he is showing off now.
  * @abstr_hyperlink which was the first open source project to make WPF truly modern.
  * @abstr_hyperlink which is a dependency injection library which defines what a good API is all about.



I have used more projects than these but these are the ones which I feel to be indispensable for any desk top project.
