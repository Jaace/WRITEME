## CNTK

| **Chat** | **Windows build status** | **Linux build status** | |-------------|-------------|---------------| | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink | @abstr_hyperlink |

The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (https://cntk.ai) is a unified deep learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. In this directed graph, leaf nodes represent input values or network parameters, while other nodes represent matrix operations upon their inputs. CNTK allows users to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional nets (CNNs), and recurrent networks (RNNs/LSTMs). It implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers. CNTK has been available under an open-source license since April @abstr_number . It is our hope that the community will take advantage of CNTK to share ideas more quickly through the exchange of open source working code.

## Disclaimer

Dear community, 

With our ongoing contributions to ONNX and the ONNX Runtime, we have made it easier to interoperate within the AI framework ecosystem and to access high performance, cross-platform inferencing capabilities for both traditional ML models and deep neural networks. Over the last few years we have been privileged to develop such key open-source machine learning projects, including the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, which has enabled its users to leverage industry-wide advancements in deep learning at scale. 

Todayâ€™s @abstr_number . @abstr_number release will be the last main release of CNTK. We may have some subsequent minor releases for bug fixes, but these will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. There are no plans for new feature development post this release. 

The CNTK @abstr_number . @abstr_number release has full support for ONNX @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number , and we encourage those seeking to operationalize their CNTK models to take advantage of ONNX and the ONNX Runtime. Moving forward, users can continue to leverage evolving ONNX innovations via the number of frameworks that support it. For example, users can natively export ONNX models from PyTorch or convert TensorFlow models to ONNX with the TensorFlow-ONNX converter. 

We are incredibly grateful for all the support we have received from contributors and users over the years since the initial open-source release of CNTK. CNTK has enabled both Microsoft teams and external users to execute complex and large-scale workloads in all manner of deep learning applications, such as historical breakthroughs in speech recognition achieved by Microsoft Speech researchers, the originators of the framework. 

As ONNX is increasingly employed in serving models used across Microsoft products such as Bing and Office, we are dedicated to synthesizing innovations from research with the rigorous demands of production to progress the ecosystem forward. 

Above all, our goal is to make innovations in deep learning across the software and hardware stacks as open and accessible as possible. We will be working hard to bring both the existing strengths of CNTK and new state-of-the-art research into other open-source projects to truly broaden the reach of such technologies. 

With gratitude, 

\-- The CNTK Team

### Project changelog

*** @abstr_number - @abstr_number - @abstr_number .*** CNTK @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number 

## Efficient group convolution

The implementation of group convolution in CNTK has been updated. The updated implementation moves away from creating a sub-graph for group convolution (using slicing and splicing), and instead uses cuDNN @abstr_number and MKL @abstr_number APIs directly. This improves the experience both in terms of performance and model size. 

As an example, for a single group convolution op with the following attributes:

  * Input tensor (C, H, W) = ( @abstr_number , @abstr_number , @abstr_number )
  * Number of output channels = @abstr_number (channel multiplier is @abstr_number )
  * Groups = @abstr_number (depth wise convolution)
  * Kernel size = ( @abstr_number , @abstr_number )



The comparison numbers for this single node are as follows:

| First Header | GPU exec. time (in millisec., @abstr_number run avg.) | CPU exec. time (in millisec., @abstr_number run avg.) | Model Size (in KB, CNTK format) | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | | Old implementation | @abstr_number . @abstr_number | @abstr_number . @abstr_number | @abstr_number | | New implementation | @abstr_number . @abstr_number | @abstr_number . @abstr_number | @abstr_number | | Speedup/savings Approx. | @abstr_number % Approx. | @abstr_number - @abstr_number % Approx. | @abstr_number % |

## Sequential Convolution

The implementation of sequential convolution in CNTK has been updated. The updated implementation creates a separate sequential convolution layer. Different from regular convolution layer, this operation convolves also on the dynamic axis(sequence), and filter_shape[ @abstr_number ] is applied to that axis. The updated implementation supports broader cases, such as where stride > @abstr_number for the sequence axis.

For example, a sequential convolution over a batch of one-channel black-and-white images. The images have the same fixed height of @abstr_number , but each with width of variable lengths. The width is then represented by sequential axis. Padding is enabled, and strides for both width and height are @abstr_number .
    
    
     >>> f = SequentialConvolution(( @abstr_number , @abstr_number ), reduction_rank= @abstr_number , pad=True, strides=( @abstr_number , @abstr_number ), activation=C.relu)
     >>> x = C.input_variable(**Sequence[Tensor[ @abstr_number ]])
     >>> x.shape
         ( @abstr_number ,)
     >>> h = f(x)
     >>> h.shape
         ( @abstr_number ,)
     >>> f.W.shape
         ( @abstr_number ,  @abstr_number ,  @abstr_number ,  @abstr_number )
    

## Operators

### depth_to_space and space_to_depth

There is a breaking change in the **depth_to_space** and **space_to_depth** operators. These have been updated to match ONNX specification, specifically the permutation for how the depth dimension is placed as blocks in the spatial dimensions, and vice-versa, has been changed. Please refer to the updated doc examples for these two ops to see the change.

### Tan and Atan

Added support for trigonometric ops `Tan` and `Atan`.

### ELU

Added support for `alpha` attribute in ELU op.

### Convolution

Updated auto padding algorithms of `Convolution` to produce symmetric padding at best effort on CPU, without affecting the final convolution output values. This update increases the range of cases that could be covered by MKL API and improves the performance, E.g. ResNet @abstr_number .

## Default arguments order

There is a breaking change in the **arguments** property in CNTK python API. The default behavior has been updated to return arguments in python order instead of in C++ order. This way it will return arguments in the same order as they are fed into ops. If you wish to still get arguments in C++ order, you can simply override the global option. This change should only affect the following ops: Times, TransposeTimes, and Gemm(internal). 

## Bug fixes

  * Updated doc for Convolution layer to include group and dilation arguments.
  * Added improved input validation for group convolution.
  * Updated `LogSoftMax` to use more numerically stable implementation.
  * Fixed Gather op's incorrect gradient value.
  * Added validation for 'None' node in python clone substitution.
  * Added validation for padding channel axis in convolution.
  * Added CNTK native default lotusIR logger to fix the "Attempt to use DefaultLogger" error when loading some ONNX models.
  * Added proper initialization for ONNX TypeStrToProtoMap.
  * Updated python doctest to handle different print format for newer version numpy(version >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number ).
  * Fixed Pooling(CPU) to produce correct output values when kernel center is on padded input cells.



## ONNX

### Updates

  * Updated CNTK's ONNX import/export to use ONNX @abstr_number . @abstr_number spec.
  * Major update to how batch and sequence axes are handled in export and import. As a result, the complex scenarios and edge cases are handled accurately.
  * Updated CNTK's ONNX `BatchNormalization` op export/import to latest spec.
  * Added model domain to ONNX model export.
  * Improved error reporting during import and export of ONNX models.
  * Updated `DepthToSpace` and `SpaceToDepth` ops to match ONNX spec on the permutation for how the depth dimension is placed as block dimension.
  * Added support for exporting `alpha` attribute in `ELU` ONNX op.
  * Major overhaul to `Convolution` and `Pooling` export. Unlike before, these ops do not export an explicit `Pad` op in any situation.
  * Major overhaul to `ConvolutionTranspose` export and import. Attributes such as `output_shape`, `output_padding`, and `pads` are fully supported.
  * Added support for CNTK's `StopGradient` as a no-op.
  * Added ONNX support for TopK op.
  * Added ONNX support for sequence ops: sequence.slice, sequence.first, sequence.last, sequence.reduce_sum, sequence.reduce_max, sequence.softmax. For these ops, there is no need to expand ONNX spec. CNTK ONNX exporter just builds computation equivalent graphs for these sequence ops.
  * Added full support for Softmax op.
  * Made CNTK broadcast ops compatible with ONNX specification.
  * Handle to_batch, to_sequence, unpack_batch, sequence.unpack ops in CNTK ONNX exporter.
  * ONNX tests to export ONNX test cases for other toolkits to run and to validate.
  * Fixed `Hardmax`/`Softmax`/`LogSoftmax` import/export.
  * Added support for `Select` op export.
  * Added import/export support for several trigonometric ops.
  * Updated CNTK support for ONNX `MatMul` op.
  * Updated CNTK support for ONNX `Gemm` op.
  * Updated CNTK's ONNX `MeanVarianceNormalization` op export/import to latest spec.
  * Updated CNTK's ONNX `LayerNormalization` op export/import to latest spec.

  * Updated CNTK's ONNX `Reduce` ops export/import to latest spec.
  * Updated CNTK's ONNX `Flatten` op export/import to latest spec.
  * Added CNTK support for ONNX `Unsqueeze` op.



### Bug or minor fixes:

  * Updated LRN op to match ONNX @abstr_number . @abstr_number spec where the `size` attribute has the semantics of diameter, not radius. Added validation if LRN kernel size is larger than channel size.
  * Updated `Min`/`Max` import implementation to handle variadic inputs.
  * Fixed possible file corruption when resaving on top of existing ONNX model file.



## .Net Support

The Cntk.Core.Managed library has officially been converted to .Net Standard and supports .Net Core and .Net Framework applications on both Windows and Linux. Starting from this release, .Net developers should be able to restore CNTK Nuget packages using new .Net SDK style project file with package management format set to PackageReference.

The following C# code now works on both Windows and Linux:
    
    
     >>> var weightParameterName = "weight";
     >>> var biasParameterName = "bias";
     >>> var inputName = "input";
     >>> var outputDim =  @abstr_number ;
     >>> var inputDim =  @abstr_number ;
     >>> Variable inputVariable = Variable.InputVariable(new int[] { inputDim }, DataType.Float, inputName);
     >>> var weightParameter = new Parameter(new int[] { outputDim, inputDim }, DataType.Float,  @abstr_number , device, weightParameterName);
     >>> var biasParameter = new Parameter(new int[] { outputDim }, DataType.Float,  @abstr_number , device, biasParameterName);
     >>> 
     >>> Function modelFunc = CNTKLib.Times(weightParameter, inputVariable) + biasParameter;
    

For example, simply adding an ItemGroup clause in the .csproj file of a .Net Core application is sufficient:

> > > netcoreapp @abstr_number . @abstr_number  x @abstr_number 

### Bug or minor fixes:

  * Fixed C# string and char to native wstring and wchar UTF conversion issues on Linux.
  * Fixed multibyte and wide character conversions across the codebase.
  * Fixed Nuget package mechanism to pack for .Net Standard.
  * Fixed a memory leak issue in Value class in C# API where Dispose was not called upon object destruction.

_*_ @abstr_number - @abstr_number - @abstr_number .* CNTK @abstr_number . @abstr_number **

Highlights: * Moved to CUDA @abstr_number , cuDNN @abstr_number and Visual Studio @abstr_number . * Removed Python @abstr_number . @abstr_number support. * Added Volta GPU and FP @abstr_number support. * Better ONNX support. * CPU perf improvement. * More OPs.

OPs * `top_k` operation: in the forward pass it computes the top (largest) k values and corresponding indices along the specified axis. In the backward pass the gradient is scattered to the top k elements (an element not in the top k gets a zero gradient). * `gather` operation now supports an axis argument * `squeeze` and `expand_dims` operations for easily removing and adding singleton axes * `zeros_like` and `ones_like` operations. In many situations you can just rely on CNTK correctly broadcasting a simple @abstr_number or @abstr_number but sometimes you need the actual tensor. * `depth_to_space`: Rearranges elements in the input tensor from the depth dimension into spatial blocks. Typical use of this operation is for implementing sub-pixel convolution for some image super-resolution models. * `space_to_depth`: Rearranges elements in the input tensor from the spatial dimensions to the depth dimension. It is largely the inverse of DepthToSpace. * `sum` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes element-wise sum of input tensors. * `softsign` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the element-wise softsign of a input tensor. * `asinh` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the element-wise asinh of a input tensor. * `log_softmax` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the logsoftmax normalized values of a input tensor. * `hard_sigmoid` operation: Create a new Function instance that computes the hard_sigmoid normalized values of a input tensor. * `element_and`, `element_not`, `element_or`, `element_xor` element-wise logic operations * `reduce_l @abstr_number` operation: Computes the L @abstr_number norm of the input tensor's element along the provided axes. * `reduce_l @abstr_number` operation: Computes the L @abstr_number norm of the input tensor's element along the provided axes. * `reduce_sum_square` operation: Computes the sum square of the input tensor's element along the provided axes. * `image_scaler` operation: Alteration of image by scaling its individual values.

ONNX * There have been several improvements to ONNX support in CNTK. * Updates * Updated ONNX `Reshape` op to handle `InferredDimension`. * Adding `producer_name` and `producer_version` fields to ONNX models. * Handling the case when neither `auto_pad` nor `pads` atrribute is specified in ONNX `Conv` op. * Bug fixes * Fixed bug in ONNX `Pooling` op serialization * Bug fix to create ONNX `InputVariable` with only one batch axis. * Bug fixes and updates to implementation of ONNX `Transpose` op to match updated spec. * Bug fixes and updates to implementation of ONNX `Conv`, `ConvTranspose`, and `Pooling` ops to match updated spec.

Operators * Group convolution * Fixed bug in group convolution. Output of CNTK `Convolution` op will change for groups > @abstr_number . More optimized implementation of group convolution is expected in the next release. * Better error reporting for group convolution in `Convolution` layer.

Halide Binary Convolution \- The CNTK build can now use optional @abstr_hyperlink libraries to build `Cntk.BinaryConvolution.so/dll` library that can be used with the `netopt` module. The library contains optimized binary convolution operators that perform better than the python based binarized convolution operators. To enable Halide in the build, please download @abstr_hyperlink and set `HALIDE_PATH` environment varibale before starting a build. In Linux, you can use `./configure --with-halide[=directory]` to enable it. For more information on how to use this feature, please refer to @abstr_hyperlink .
