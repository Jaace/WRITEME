## Visual Studio @abstr_number and Visual Studio @abstr_number installation

The Python development workload is available as part of @abstr_hyperlink Community, Professional and Enterprise. To install, run the @abstr_hyperlink and select either the **Python development workload** or the **Data science and analytical applications workload**.

## Visual Studio @abstr_number and earlier

Prior to Visual Studio @abstr_number , Python support was released as a standalone extension. We are no longer actively developing these versions, but if you are unable to upgrade to Visual Studio @abstr_number yet, you can use these older installers to get Python support.

@abstr_hyperlink is the latest available version for Visual Studio @abstr_number . You can also find it in the Visual Studio @abstr_number installer by selecting "Custom" and looking under the "Programming Languages" category.

@abstr_hyperlink is the last release for Visual Studio @abstr_number users.

Thank you for using and supporting Python Tools for Visual Studio.
