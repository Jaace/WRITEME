#  @abstr_image Source Code

To load the source project you will need Visual Studio @abstr_number . Don't worry if you have an earlier version, you can still use the compiled assemblies from NuGet (`Install-Package MaterialDesignThemes`). There are two demo projects in the solution, restore the necessary NuGet packages and correct the programming syntax that is not compatible with C# versions lower than C# @abstr_number . @abstr_number (`currently used in Visual Studio @abstr_number`). Then, you should be able to fire both of these projects up. One is a "pure" Material Design project, the other illustrates how to combine with Dragablz & MahApps.
