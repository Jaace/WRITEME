## Quickstart

Conky comes bundled with many package managers. However, if you'd like to try the latest release of Conky, you can try the AppImage build. If you have `jq` and `curl` installed, run the following command to fetch the latest AppImage:

`ShellSession $ curl -sL -o conky-x @abstr_number _ @abstr_number .AppImage \ $(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/brndnmtthws/conky/releases/latest | \ jq --raw-output '.assets[ @abstr_number ] | .browser_download_url') $ ls conky-x @abstr_number _ @abstr_number .AppImage @abstr_code_section ShellSession $ chmod +x ./conky-x @abstr_number _ @abstr_number .AppImage $ ./conky-x @abstr_number _ @abstr_number .AppImage -C > ~/.conkyrc $ ./conky-x @abstr_number _ @abstr_number .AppImage `

And that's it! @abstr_hyperlink for more details on configuring Conky.
