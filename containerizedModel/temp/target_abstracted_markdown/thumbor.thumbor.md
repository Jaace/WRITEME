thumbor is a smart imaging service. It enables on-demand @abstr_hyperlink of images.

It also features a VERY smart detection of important points in the image for better cropping and resizing, using state-of-the-art face and feature detection algorithms (more on that in @abstr_hyperlink ).

Using thumbor is very easy (after it is running). All you have to do is access it using an URL for an image, like this:

@abstr_code_section 

That URL would show an image of the big brother brasil participants in @abstr_number x @abstr_number using smart crop.

There are several other options to the image URL configuration. You can check them in the @abstr_hyperlink .

For more information check @abstr_hyperlink .
