# Welcome to NHibernate

NHibernate is a mature, open source object-relational mapper for the .NET framework. It is actively developed, fully featured and used in thousands of successful projects.

The NHibernate community website - @abstr_hyperlink - has a range of resources to help you get started, including @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink .

## Latest Version

The quickest way to get the latest release of NHibernate is to add it to your project using NuGet ( @abstr_hyperlink ).

Alternatively binaries are available from SourceForge at @abstr_hyperlink .

You are encouraged to review the release notes (releasenotes.txt), particularly when upgrading to a later version. The release notes will generally document any breaking changes.

## Community Forums

There are two official NHibernate community forums:

  * @abstr_hyperlink - a forum for users to find help using NHibernate
  * @abstr_hyperlink - a forum for the developers of NHibernate



## Bug Reports

If you find any bugs, please report them using the GitHub issue tracker. A test-case that demonstrates the issue is usually required. Instructions on providing a test-case can be found in contributing guidelines or here.
