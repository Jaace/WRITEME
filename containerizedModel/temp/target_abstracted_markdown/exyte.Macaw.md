## Motivation

Modern designs contain tons of illustrations and complex animations. Mobile developers have to spend a lot of time on converting designs into native views that will be resizable for different screens. With Macaw you can reduce development time to a minimum and describe all graphics in high level @abstr_hyperlink elements. Or even render SVG graphics right from your design tool with Macaw events and animation support.
