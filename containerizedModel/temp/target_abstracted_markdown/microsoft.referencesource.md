# .NET Reference Source

The referencesource repository contains sources from @abstr_hyperlink that represent a subset of the .NET Framework. This subset contains similar functionality to the class libraries that are being developed in @abstr_hyperlink . We intend to consult the referencesource repository as we develop .NET Core. It is also for the community to leverage to enable more scenarios for .NET developers. 

**Please note that the referencesource repository is read-only**. @abstr_hyperlink for the rationale.

Questions, bugs, and pull requests should be done through @abstr_hyperlink .
