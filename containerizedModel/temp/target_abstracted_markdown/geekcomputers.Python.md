# My Python Examples

I do not consider myself a programmer. I create these little programs as experiments to play with the language, or to solve problems for myself. I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at craig@geekcomputers.co.uk.
