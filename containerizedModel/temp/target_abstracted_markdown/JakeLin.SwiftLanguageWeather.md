# Swift Language Weather

@abstr_hyperlink @abstr_image @abstr_image 

**SwiftWeather** has renamed to **Swift Language Weather**. Because this repo is ranked number one in Google when we search "Swift Weather", I got an email from Swift Weather Company's lawyer to ask me to change the name because they said they are the owner of U.S. Trademark SWIFT WEATHER. After discussed with them, they were not happy with the name Swift **y** Weather. Now the new project name is **Swift Language Weather**. More details can be found on @abstr_hyperlink .

**Swift Language Weather** is an iOS weather app developed in Swift @abstr_number . The app has been actively upgrading to adopt the latest features of iOS and Swift language.
