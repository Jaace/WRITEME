## Getting Started

@abstr_hyperlink is the easiest and fastest way to use Umbraco yet, with full support for all your custom .NET code and integrations. You're up and running in less than a minute, and your life will be made easier with automated upgrades and a built-in deployment engine. We offer a free @abstr_number -day trial, no credit card needed.

If you want to DIY, you can download Umbraco either as a ZIP file or via NuGet. It's the same version of Umbraco CMS that powers Umbraco Cloud, but you'll need to find a place to host it yourself, and handling deployments and upgrades will be all up to you.
