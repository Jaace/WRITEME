Orleans is a framework that provides a straight-forward approach to building distributed high-scale computing applications, without the need to learn and apply complex concurrency or other scaling patterns. 

It was created by @abstr_hyperlink implementing the @abstr_hyperlink and designed for use in the cloud. 

Orleans has been used extensively running in Microsoft Azure by several Microsoft product groups, most notably by @abstr_hyperlink as a platform for all of Halo @abstr_number and Halo @abstr_number cloud services, as well as by @abstr_hyperlink .

# Installation

Installation is performed via @abstr_hyperlink . There are several packages, one for each different project type (interfaces, grains, silo, and client).

In the grain interfaces project: @abstr_code_section In the grain implementations project: @abstr_code_section In the server (silo) project: @abstr_code_section In the client project: @abstr_code_section 

### Official Builds

The stable production-quality release is located @abstr_hyperlink .

The latest clean development branch build from CI is located: @abstr_hyperlink 

Nightly builds are published to https://dotnet.myget.org/gallery/orleans-ci . These builds pass all functional tests, but are not thoroughly tested as the stable builds or pre-release builds we push to NuGet.org

To use nightly builds in your project, add the MyGet feed using either of the following methods:

@abstr_number . Changing the .csproj file to include this section:

@abstr_code_section or

@abstr_number . Creating a `NuGet.config` file in the solution directory with the following contents:

@abstr_code_section 

### Building from source

Clone the sources from the GitHub @abstr_hyperlink 

Run the `Build.cmd` script to build the nuget packages locally, then reference the required NuGet packages from `/Artifacts/Release/*`. You can run `Test.cmd` to run all BVT tests, and `TestAll.cmd` to also run Functional tests (which take much longer)

### Building and running tests in Visual Studio @abstr_number

.NET Core @abstr_number . @abstr_number SDK is a pre-requisite to build Orleans.sln.

There might be errors trying to build from Visual Studio because of conflicts with the test discovery engine (error says could not copy `xunit.abstractions.dll`). The reason for that error is that you need to configure the test runner in VS like so (after opening the solution): * `Test` -> `Test Settings` -> Uncheck `Keep Test Execution Engine running` * `Test` -> `Test Settings` -> `Default Processor Architecture` -> Check `X @abstr_number`

Then either restart VS, or go to the task manager and kill the processes that starts with `vstest.`. Then build once again and it should succeed and tests should appear in the `Test Explorer` window.

# Documentation

Documentation is located @abstr_hyperlink 

# Code Examples

Create an interface for your grain: ```c# public interface IHello : Orleans.IGrainWithIntegerKey { Task SayHello(string greeting); } @abstr_code_section c# public class HelloGrain : Orleans.Grain, IHello { public Task SayHello(string greeting) { return Task.FromResult($"You said: '{greeting}', I say: Hello!"); } } @abstr_code_section c# // Get a reference to the IHello grain with id ' @abstr_number '. var friend = GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain( @abstr_number );

// Send a greeting to the grain and await the response. Console.WriteLine(await friend.SayHello("Good morning, my friend!")); ```

# Blog

@abstr_hyperlink is a place to share our thoughts, plans, learnings, tips and tricks, and ideas, crazy and otherwise, which donâ€™t easily fit the documentation format. We would also like to see here posts from the community members, sharing their experiences, ideas, and wisdom. So, welcome to Orleans Blog, both as a reader and as a blogger!
