# Zulip overview

Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application that combines the immediacy of real-time chat with the productivity benefits of threaded conversations. Zulip is used by open source projects, Fortune @abstr_number companies, large standards bodies, and others who need a real-time chat system that allows users to easily process hundreds or thousands of messages a day. With over @abstr_number contributors merging over @abstr_number commits a month, Zulip is also the largest and fastest growing open source group chat project.
