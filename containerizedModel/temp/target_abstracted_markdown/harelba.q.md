# q - Text as Data

q is a command line tool that allows direct execution of SQL-like queries on CSVs/TSVs (and any other tabular text files).

q treats ordinary files as database tables, and supports all SQL constructs, such as `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`s, etc. It supports automatic column name and type detection, and q provides full support for multiple character encodings.

q's web site is @abstr_hyperlink . It contains everything you need to download and use q immediately.

## Installation.

Extremely simple. 

Instructions for all OSs are @abstr_hyperlink . 

## Examples

@abstr_code_section 

Go @abstr_hyperlink for more examples.

## Python API

A development branch for exposing q's capabilities as a **Python module** can be viewed @abstr_hyperlink , along with examples of the alpha version of the API.  
Existing functionality as a command-line tool will not be affected by this. Your input will be most appreciated.
