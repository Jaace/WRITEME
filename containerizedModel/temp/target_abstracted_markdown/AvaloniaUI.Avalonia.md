## About

**Avalonia** is a WPF/UWP-inspired cross-platform XAML-based UI framework providing a flexible styling system and supporting a wide range of Operating Systems such as Windows (.NET Framework, .NET Core), Linux (via Xorg), MacOS and with experimental support for Android and iOS.

**Avalonia** is ready for **General-Purpose Desktop App Development**. However there may be some bugs and breaking changes as we continue along into this project's development. To see the status for some of our features, please see our @abstr_hyperlink .

## Getting Started

Avalonia @abstr_hyperlink contains project and control templates that will help you get started. After installing it, open "New Project" dialog in Visual Studio, choose "Avalonia" in "Visual C#" section, select "Avalonia .NET Core Application" and press OK ( @abstr_hyperlink ). Now you can write code and markup that will work on multiple platforms!

For those without Visual Studio, starter guide for .NET Core CLI can be found @abstr_hyperlink .

Avalonia is delivered via **NuGet** package manager. You can find the packages here: ( @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink )

Use these commands in Package Manager console to install Avalonia manually: @abstr_code_section 

## Bleeding Edge Builds

or use nightly build feeds as described here: https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/wiki/Using-nightly-build-feed

## Documentation

You can take a look at the @abstr_hyperlink for an overview of how to get started but probably the best thing to do for now is to already know a little bit about WPF/Silverlight/UWP/XAML and ask questions in our @abstr_hyperlink . 

There's also a high-level @abstr_hyperlink that is currently a little bit out of date, and I've also started writing blog posts on Avalonia at http://grokys.github.io/.

Contributions for our docs are always welcome!
