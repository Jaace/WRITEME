Pyro is a flexible, scalable deep probabilistic programming library built on PyTorch. Notably, it was designed with these principles in mind:

  * **Universal** : Pyro is a universal PPL - it can represent any computable probability distribution.
  * **Scalable** : Pyro scales to large data sets with little overhead compared to hand-written code.
  * **Minimal** : Pyro is agile and maintainable. It is implemented with a small core of powerful, composable abstractions.
  * **Flexible** : Pyro aims for automation when you want it, control when you need it. This is accomplished through high-level abstractions to express generative and inference models, while allowing experts easy-access to customize inference.



Pyro is in a beta release. It is developed and maintained by @abstr_hyperlink and community contributors. For more information, check out our @abstr_hyperlink .
