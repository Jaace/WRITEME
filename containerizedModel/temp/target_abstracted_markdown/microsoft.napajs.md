# Napa.js

Napa.js is a multi-threaded JavaScript runtime built on @abstr_hyperlink , which was originally designed to develop highly iterative services with non-compromised performance in Bing. As it evolves, we find it useful to complement @abstr_hyperlink in CPU-bound tasks, with the capability of executing JavaScript in multiple V @abstr_number isolates and communicating between them. Napa.js is exposed as a Node.js module, while it can also be embedded in a host process without Node.js dependency.

## Installation

Install the latest stable version: @abstr_code_section Other options can be found in @abstr_hyperlink .

## Quick Start

@abstr_code_section More examples: * Estimate PI in parallel * Max sub-matrix of @abstr_number s with layered parallelism * Parallel Quick Sort * Recursive Fibonacci with multiple JavaScript threads * Synchronized loading

## Features

  * Multi-threaded JavaScript runtime.
  * Node.js compatible module architecture with NPM support.
  * API for object transportation, object sharing and synchronization across JavaScript threads.
  * API for pluggable logging, metric and memory allocator.
  * Distributed as a Node.js module, as well as supporting embed scenarios.
