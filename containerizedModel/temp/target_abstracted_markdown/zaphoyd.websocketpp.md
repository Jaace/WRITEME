# WebSocket++ ( @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number )

WebSocket++ is a header only C++ library that implements RFC @abstr_number The WebSocket Protocol. It allows integrating WebSocket client and server functionality into C++ programs. It uses interchangeable network transport modules including one based on raw char buffers, one based on C++ iostreams, and one based on Asio (either via Boost or standalone). End users can write additional transport policies to support other networking or event libraries as needed.

# Major Features

  * Full support for RFC @abstr_number 
  * Partial support for Hixie @abstr_number / Hybi @abstr_number , @abstr_number - @abstr_number draft specs (server only)
  * Message/event based interface
  * Supports secure WebSockets (TLS), IPv @abstr_number , and explicit proxies.
  * Flexible dependency management (C++ @abstr_number Standard Library or Boost)
  * Interchangeable network transport modules (raw, iostream, Asio, or custom)
  * Portable/cross platform (Posix/Windows, @abstr_number / @abstr_number bit, Intel/ARM/PPC)
  * Thread-safe
