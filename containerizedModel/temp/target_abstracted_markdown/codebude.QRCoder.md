## Info

QRCoder is a simple library, written in C#.NET, which enables you to create QR codes. It hasn't any dependencies to other libraries and is available as .NET Framework and .NET Core PCL version on NuGet.

Feel free to grab-up/fork the project and make it better!

## Installation

Either checkout this Github repository or install QRCoder via NuGet Package Manager. If you want to use NuGet just search for "QRCoder" or run the following command in the NuGet Package Manager console: @abstr_code_section 

_Note: The NuGet feed contains only **stable** releases. If you wan't the latest build add one of the following urls to the "Package Sources" of Visual Studio's NuGet Package Manager options._

_NuGet V @abstr_number feed URL (Visual Studio @abstr_number +):_ `https://www.myget.org/F/qrcoder/api/v @abstr_number /index.json`

_NuGet V @abstr_number feed URL (Visual Studio @abstr_number +):_ `https://www.myget.org/F/qrcoder/api/v @abstr_number`

## Usage

You only need five lines of code, to generate and view your first QR code.

@abstr_code_section 

### Optional parameters and overloads

The GetGraphics-method has some more overloads. The first two enable you to set the color of the QR code graphic. One uses Color-class-types, the other HTML hex color notation.

@abstr_code_section 

The another overload enables you to render a logo/image in the center of the QR code.

@abstr_code_section 

There are a plenty of other options. So feel free to read more on that in our wiki: @abstr_hyperlink 

### Special rendering types

Besides the normal QRCode class (which is shown in the example above) for creating QR codes in Bitmap format, there are some more QR code rendering classes, each for another special purpose.

_( &ast;) - These classes are only available in the .NET Framework/.NET Standard version. If you use the PCL version (e.g. for Universal apps), you have to use either BitmapByteQRCode or PngByteQRCode classes._   
_( &ast;&ast;) - This class is hosted in an own package ( @abstr_hyperlink )._

## PayloadGenerator.cs - Generate QR code payloads

Technically QR code is just a visual representation of a text/string. Nevertheless most QR code readers can read "special" QR codes which trigger different actions.

For example: WiFi-QRcodes which, when scanned by smartphone, let the smartphone join an access point automatically.

This "special" QR codes are generated by using special structured payload string, when generating the QR code. The @abstr_hyperlink helps you to generate this payload strings. To generate a WiFi payload for example, you need just this one line of code:

@abstr_code_section 

To generate a QR code from this payload, just call the "ToString()"-method and pass it to the QRCoder.

@abstr_code_section 

You can also use overloaded method that accepts Payload as parameter. Payload generator can have QR Code Version set (default is auto set), ECC Level (default is M) and ECI mode (default is automatic detection).

@abstr_code_section 

Or if you want to override ECC Level set by Payload generator, you can use overloaded method, that allows setting ECC Level.

The PayloadGenerator supports the following types of payloads:
