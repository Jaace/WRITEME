## Welcome!

The C++ REST SDK is a Microsoft project for cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design. This project aims to help C++ developers connect to and interact with services. 

## Getting Started

@abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink 

@abstr_hyperlink 

With @abstr_hyperlink on Windows @abstr_code_section With @abstr_hyperlink on Debian/Ubuntu @abstr_code_section With @abstr_hyperlink on Fedora @abstr_code_section With @abstr_hyperlink on OSX @abstr_code_section With @abstr_hyperlink on Windows for Android @abstr_code_section For other platforms, install options, how to build from source, and more, take a look at our @abstr_hyperlink .

Once you have the library, look at our @abstr_hyperlink to use the http_client. It walks through how to setup a project to use the C++ Rest SDK and make a basic Http request.

To use from CMake: @abstr_code_section 

## What's in the SDK:

  * Features - HTTP client/server, JSON, URI, asynchronous streams, WebSockets client, oAuth
  * PPL Tasks - A powerful model for composing asynchronous operations based on C++ @abstr_number features
  * Platforms - Windows desktop, Windows Store (UWP), Linux, OS X, Unix, iOS, and Android
  * Support for @abstr_hyperlink with debugger visualizers



## Contribute Back!

Is there a feature missing that you'd like to see, or found a bug that you have a fix for? Or do you have an idea or just interest in helping out in building the library? Let us know and we'd love to work with you. For a good starting point on where we are headed and feature ideas, take a look at our @abstr_hyperlink . 

Big or small we'd like to take your @abstr_hyperlink back to help improve the C++ Rest SDK for everyone. If interested contact us askcasablanca at Microsoft dot com. 

## Having Trouble?

We'd love to get your review score, whether good or bad, but even more than that, we want to fix your problem. If you submit your issue as a Review, we won't be able to respond to your problem and ask any follow-up questions that may be necessary. The most efficient way to do that is to open an issue in our @abstr_hyperlink .
