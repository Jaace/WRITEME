###  @abstr_hyperlink 

Authoring Tools Framework (ATF) is a set of C#/.NET components for making tools on Windows®. ATF has been used by most Sony Computer Entertainment first party game studios to make many custom tools such as Naughty Dog's level editor and shader editor for _The Last of Us_™, Guerrilla Game's sequence editor for Killzone™ games (including the _Killzone: Shadow Fall_™ PS @abstr_number ™ launch title), an animation blending tool at Santa Monica Studios, a level editor at Bend Studio, a visual state machine editor for Quantic Dream, sound editing tools, and many others. ATF has been in continuous development in Sony Computer Entertainment's Worldwide Studios central tools group since early @abstr_number .

This figure shows LevelEditor, a powerful tool built with ATF for constructing and editing game levels. LevelEditor is also an open source project, available at @abstr_hyperlink . See other tools built with ATF at @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink .

There are many types of components in ATF. ATF Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) components can be added to a .NET TypeCatalog with a single line of code, which allows you to easily add these capabilities to your application. MEF components can be found in most of our sample applications, as in this Circuit Editor sample source file @abstr_hyperlink . Other components, like the Document Object Model (DOM), are actually a collection of related classes. Look over a list of useful components in ATF at @abstr_hyperlink .

ATF is an open source project. See @abstr_hyperlink .
