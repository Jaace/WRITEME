@abstr_hyperlink is a file sharing and collaboration app. It works just like Dropbox, and you can run it on your own server. It's available for Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows. @abstr_hyperlink .

## How does it work?

SparkleShare creates a special folder on your computer. You can add remotely hosted folders (or "projects") to this folder. These projects will be automatically kept in sync with both the host and all of your peers when someone adds, removes or edits a file.

## Install on Ubuntu or Fedora

You can install the package from your distribution (likely old and not updated often), but we recommend to get our Flatpak with automatic updates to always enjoy the latest and greatest:

Now you can run SparkleShare from the apps menu.

**Note:** by default SparkleShare uses an AppIndicator status icon on Linux. If you use GNOME on a distribution other than Ubuntu, please install the @abstr_hyperlink . If you don't use GNOME, you can start SparkleShare with `--status-icon=gtk`.

## Install on macOS

Download the app from the @abstr_hyperlink .

## Set up a host

Under the hood SparkleShare uses the version control system @abstr_hyperlink and the large files extension @abstr_hyperlink , so setting up a host yourself is relatively easy. Using your own host gives you more privacy and control, as well as lots of cheap storage space and higher transfer speeds. We've made a simple @abstr_hyperlink that does the hard work for you. If you need to manage a lot of projects and/or users we recommend hosting a @abstr_hyperlink instance.
