# About QGIS

@abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink 

QGIS is an Open Source Geographic Information System. The project was born in May of @abstr_number and was established as a project on SourceForge in June of the same year. We've worked hard to make GIS software (which is traditionally expensive commercial software) a viable prospect for anyone with basic access to a Personal Computer. QGIS currently runs on most Unix platforms (macOS/OS X included) and Windows. QGIS is developed using the @abstr_hyperlink and C++. This means that QGIS feels snappy to use and has a pleasing, easy to use graphical user interface.

QGIS aims to be an easy to use GIS, providing common functions and features. The initial goal was to provide a GIS data viewer. QGIS has reached that point in its evolution and is being used by many for their daily GIS data viewing and editing needs. QGIS supports a number of raster , vector and mesh data formats, with new support easily added using the plugin architecture.

QGIS is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) Version @abstr_number or above. Developing QGIS under this license means that you can (if you want to) inspect and modify the source code and guarantees that you, our happy user will always have access to a GIS program that is free of cost and can be freely modified.

## Contribute

QGIS is on GitHub at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS. If you wish to contribute patches you can @abstr_hyperlink , make your changes, commit to your repository, and then @abstr_hyperlink . The development team can then review your contribution and commit it upstream as appropriate. If you commit a new feature, add [FEATURE] to your commit message AND give a clear description of the new feature. A webhook will automatically create an issue on the QGIS-Documentation repo to tell people to write documentation about it.

If you are not a developer, there are many other possibilities which do not require programming skills to help QGIS to evolve. Check our @abstr_hyperlink .
