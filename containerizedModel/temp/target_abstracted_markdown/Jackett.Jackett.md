This project is a new fork and is recruiting development help. If you are able to help out please contact us.

Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps ( @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink etc) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.

Developer note: The software implements the @abstr_hyperlink (with @abstr_hyperlink category numbering) and @abstr_hyperlink APIs.

Trackers marked with have no active maintainer and are missing features or are broken. If you have an invite for them please send it to kaso @abstr_number -at- gmail.com to get them fixed/improved.

### Aggregate indexers

A special "all" indexer is available at `/api/v @abstr_number . @abstr_number /indexers/all/results/torznab`. It will query all configured indexers and return the combined results.

If your client supports multiple feeds it's recommended to add each indexer directly instead of using the all indexer. Using the all indexer has no advantages (besides reduced management overhead), only disadvantages: * you lose control over indexer specific settings (categories, search modes, etc.) * mixing search modes (IMDB, query, etc.) might cause low quality results * indexer specific categories (>= @abstr_number ) can't be used. * slow indexers will slow down the overall result * total results are limited to @abstr_number 

To get all Jackett indexers including their capabilities you can use `t=indexers` on the all indexer. To get only configured/unconfigured indexers you can also add `configured=true/false` as query parameter.

## Installation on Windows

We recommend you install Jackett as a Windows service using the supplied installer. You may also download the zipped version if you would like to configure everything manually.

To get started with using the installer for Jackett, follow the steps below:

@abstr_number . Download the latest version of the Windows installer, "Jackett.Installer.Windows.exe" from the @abstr_hyperlink page. @abstr_number . When prompted if you would like this app to make changes to your computer, select "yes". @abstr_number . If you would like to install Jackett as a Windows Service, make sure the "Install as Windows Service" checkbox is filled. @abstr_number . Once the installation has finished, check the "Launch Jackett" box to get started. @abstr_number . Navigate your web browser to: http:// @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number : @abstr_number @abstr_number . You're now ready to begin adding your trackers and using Jackett.

When installed as a service the tray icon acts as a way to open/start/stop Jackett. If you opted to not install it as a service then Jackett will run its web server from the tray tool.

Jackett can also be run from the command line if you would like to see log messages (Ensure the server isn't already running from the tray/service). This can be done by using "JackettConsole.exe" (for Command Prompt), found in the Jackett data folder: "%ProgramData%\Jackett".

## Installation on Linux (ARMv @abstr_number or below)

@abstr_number . Install @abstr_hyperlink or better (using the latest stable release is recommended) * Follow the instructions on the mono website and install the `mono-devel` and the `ca-certificates-mono` packages. * On Red Hat/CentOS/openSUSE/Fedora the `mono-locale-extras` package is also required. @abstr_number . Install libcurl: * Debian/Ubunutu: `apt-get install libcurl @abstr_number -openssl-dev` * Redhat/Fedora: `yum install libcurl-devel` * For other distros see the @abstr_hyperlink . @abstr_number . Download and extract the latest `Jackett.Binaries.Mono.tar.gz` release from the @abstr_hyperlink and run Jackett using mono with the command `mono --debug JackettConsole.exe`. @abstr_number . (Optional) To install Jackett as a service, open the Terminal and run `sudo ./install_service_systemd_mono.sh` You need root permissions to install the service. The service will start on each logon. You can always stop it by running `systemctl stop jackett.service` from Terminal. You can start it again it using `systemctl start jackett.service`. Logs are stored as usual under `~/.config/Jackett/log.txt` and also in `journalctl -u jackett.service`.

If you want to run it with a user without a /home directory you need to add `Environment=XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/path/to/folder` to your systemd file, this folder will be used to store your config files. 

Mono must be compiled with the Roslyn compiler (default), using MCS will cause "An error has occurred." errors (See https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett/issues/ @abstr_number ).

### Installation on Linux via Ansible

On a CentOS/RedHat @abstr_number system: @abstr_hyperlink 

On an Ubuntu @abstr_number system: @abstr_hyperlink 

## Installation on macOS

### Prerequisites

macOS @abstr_number . @abstr_number or greater

### Install as service

@abstr_number . Download and extract the latest `Jackett.Binaries.macOS.tar.gz` release from the @abstr_hyperlink . @abstr_number . Open the extracted folder and double-click on `install_service_macos`. @abstr_number . If the installation was a success, you can close the Terminal window.

The service will start on each logon. You can always stop it by running `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.user.Jackett.plist` from Terminal. You can start it again it using `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.user.Jackett.plist`. Logs are stored as usual under `~/.config/Jackett/log.txt`.

### Run without installing as a service

Download and extract the latest `Jackett.Binaries.macOS.tar.gz` release from the @abstr_hyperlink and run Jackett with the command `./jackett`.

### upgrading from mono

If you were previously using the Mono flavour of Jackett then you should shutdown the service from a terminal with with the command `systemctl stop jackett.service` and then remove the startup script at `/etc/systemd/system/jackett.service` and delete the content of the `/Applications/Jackett` folder, prior to performing this install.

## Installation using Docker

Detailed instructions are available at @abstr_hyperlink . The Jackett Docker is highly recommended, especially if you are having Mono stability issues or having issues running Mono on your system eg. QNAP, Synology. Thanks to @abstr_hyperlink 

## Installation on Synology

Jackett is available as beta package from @abstr_hyperlink 

## Running Jackett behind a reverse proxy

When running jackett behind a reverse proxy make sure that the original hostname of the request is passed to Jackett. If HTTPS is used also set the X-Forwarded-Proto header to "https". Don't forget to adjust the "Base Path Override" Jackett option accordingly.

Example config for apache: @abstr_code_section 

Example config for nginx: @abstr_code_section 

## Troubleshooting

  * __Command line switches__

You can pass various options when running via the command line, see --help for details.

  * __Error "An error occurred while sending the request: Error: TrustFailure (A call to SSPI failed, see inner exception.)"__

This is often caused by missing CA certificates. Try reimporting the certificates in this case:

    * On Linux (as user root): `wget -O - https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem | cert-sync /dev/stdin`
    * On macOS: `curl -sS https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem | cert-sync --user /dev/stdin`
  * __Enable enhanced logging__

You can get _enhanced_ logging with the command line switches `-t -l` or by enabling `Enhanced logging` via the web interface (followed by clicking on the `Apply Server Settings` button). Please post logs if you are unable to resolve your issue with these switches ensuring to remove your username/password/cookies. The logfiles (log.txt/updater.txt) are stored in `%ProgramData%\Jackett` on Windows and `~/.config/Jackett/` on Linux/macOS.




## Configuring OMDb

This feature is used as a fallback (when using the aggregate Indexer) to get the movie/series title if only the IMDB ID is provided in the request. To use it, please just request a free API key on @abstr_hyperlink ( @abstr_number , @abstr_number daily requests limit) and paste the key in Jackett

## Creating an issue

Please supply as much information about the problem you are experiencing as possible. Your issue has a much greater chance of being resolved if logs are supplied so that we can see what is going on. Creating an issue with '### isn't working' doesn't help anyone to fix the problem.

## Contributing

Jackett's framework typically allows our team and volunteering developers to implement new trackers in a couple of hours

Depending on logic complexity, there are two common ways new trackers are implemented:

@abstr_number . simple @abstr_hyperlink (.yml / YAML), and; @abstr_number . advanced (native) @abstr_hyperlink (.cs / C#)

Read more about the @abstr_hyperlink .

If you are a developer then it's recommended to download the free community version of @abstr_hyperlink 

If you are not a developer and would like a (new) tracker supported then feel free to leave an @abstr_hyperlink request.

All contributions are welcome just send a pull request.
