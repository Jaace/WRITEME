## What is Zcash?

@abstr_hyperlink is an implementation of the "Zerocash" protocol. Based on Bitcoin's code, Zcash intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata. More technical details are available in our @abstr_hyperlink .

This software is the Zcash client. It downloads and stores the entire history of Zcash transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the blockchain has reached a significant size.
