## What it is

_DB Browser for SQLite_ (DB @abstr_number S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.

DB @abstr_number S is for users and developers who want to create, search, and edit databases. DB @abstr_number S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and complicated SQL commands do not have to be learned.

Controls and wizards are available for users to:

  * Create and compact database files
  * Create, define, modify and delete tables
  * Create, define, and delete indexes
  * Browse, edit, add, and delete records
  * Search records
  * Import and export records as text
  * Import and export tables from/to CSV files
  * Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files
  * Issue SQL queries and inspect the results
  * Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application
  * Plot simple graphs based on table or query data



## What it is not

This program is not a visual shell for the sqlite command line tool, and does not require familiarity with SQL commands. It is a tool to be used by both developers and end users, and must remain as simple to use as possible in order to achieve these goals.

## Nightly builds

Download nightly builds for Windows and OSX here:

  * https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest



## Windows

Download Windows releases here:

  * https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/#windows



**Note** \- If for some reason the standard Windows release does not work (e.g. gives an error), try a nightly build. Nightly builds often fix bugs reported after the last release. :D

## MacOS X / macOS

DB Browser for SQLite works well on MacOS X / macOS.

  * OSX @abstr_number . @abstr_number (Mountain Lion) - @abstr_number . @abstr_number (High Sierra) are tested and known to work



Download OSX releases here:

  * https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/#macos

## Linux

DB Browser for SQLite works well on Linux.

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux provides a package through pacman.

### Fedora

Install for Fedora (i @abstr_number and x @abstr_number _ @abstr_number ) by issuing the following command:
    
    
    $ sudo dnf install sqlitebrowser
    

### openSUSE
    
    
    $ sudo zypper install sqlitebrowser
    

### Debian

Note that Debian focuses more on stability rather than newest features. Therefore packages will typically contain some older (but well tested) version, compared to the latest release.

Update the cache using:
    
    
    sudo apt-get update
    

Install the package using:
    
    
    sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser
    

### Ubuntu and Derivatives

#### Stable release

For Ubuntu and derivaties, @abstr_hyperlink provides a PPA with the latest release here:

  * https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser



To add this ppa just type in these commands in terminal:
    
    
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser
    

Then update the cache using:
    
    
    sudo apt-get update
    

Install the package using:
    
    
    sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser
    

Ubuntu @abstr_number . @abstr_number .X, @abstr_number . @abstr_number .X, @abstr_number . @abstr_number .X and @abstr_number . @abstr_number .X are supported for now (until Launchpad decides to discontinue building for any series).

Ubuntu Precise ( @abstr_number . @abstr_number ) and Utopic ( @abstr_number . @abstr_number ) are not supported: * Precise does not have a new enough Qt package in its repository by default, which is a dependency * Launchpad does not support Utopic any more, which has reached its End of Life

#### Nightly builds

Nightly builds are available here:

  * https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser-testing



To add this ppa, type these commands into the terminal:
    
    
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser-testing
    

Then update the cache using:
    
    
    sudo apt-get update
    

Install the package using:
    
    
    sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser
    

### Other Linux

On others, compile DB @abstr_number S using the instructions in BUILDING.md.

## FreeBSD

DB Browser for SQLite works well on FreeBSD, and there is a port for it (thanks to @abstr_hyperlink :smile:). DB @abstr_number S can be installed using either this command:
    
    
    # make -C /usr/ports/databases/sqlitebrowser install
    

or this command:
    
    
    # pkg install sqlitebrowser
    

## Snap packages

## History

This program was developed originally by Mauricio Piacentini ( @abstr_hyperlink ) from Tabuleiro Producoes, as the Arca Database Browser. The original version was used as a free companion tool to the Arca Database Xtra, a commercial product that embeds SQLite databases with some additional extensions to handle compressed and binary data.

The original code was trimmed and adjusted to be compatible with standard SQLite @abstr_number .x databases. The resulting program was renamed SQLite Database Browser, and released into the Public Domain by Mauricio. Icons were contributed by @abstr_hyperlink , also from Tabuleiro. Jens Miltner ( @abstr_hyperlink ) contributed the code to support SQLite @abstr_number .x databases for the @abstr_number . @abstr_number release.

Pete Morgan ( @abstr_hyperlink ) created an initial project on GitHub with the code in @abstr_number , where several contributors fixed and improved pieces over the years. Ren√© Peinthor ( @abstr_hyperlink ) and Martin Kleusberg ( @abstr_hyperlink ) then became involved, and have been the main driving force from that point. Justin Clift ( @abstr_hyperlink ) helps out with testing on OSX, and started the new github.com/sqlitebrowser organisation on GitHub.

@abstr_hyperlink , of @abstr_hyperlink fame, created the new logo. He based it on the Tango icon set (public domain).

In August @abstr_number , the project was renamed to "Database Browser for SQLite" at the request of @abstr_hyperlink (creator of @abstr_hyperlink ), as the previous name was creating unintended support issues.

In September @abstr_number , the project was renamed to "DB Browser for SQLite", to avoid confusion with an existing application called "Database Browser".
