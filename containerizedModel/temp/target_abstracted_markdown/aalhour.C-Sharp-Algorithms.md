# C# ALGORITHMS @abstr_hyperlink 

A C# plug-and-play class-library project of standard Data Structures and Algorithms. It contains @abstr_number + Data Structures and @abstr_number + Algorithms designed as Object-Oriented isolated components. Even though this project started for educational purposes, the implemented Data Structures and Algorithms are standard, efficient, stable and tested.

## DESCRIPTION

This project originally started out as an interview preparation project. However, after receiving a great amount of positive responses on @abstr_hyperlink , and noticing excitement from a few @abstr_hyperlink to contribute furthermore to it, the project took on a different meaning. So, I decided to keep maintaining it as a reference for data structures and algorithm implementations in C# as well as my own research side-project under these topics.

#### Solution Hierarchy:

This is a C#.NET solution-project, and it contains three subprojects:

@abstr_number . Algorithms: A class library project. Contains the Algorithms implementations. @abstr_number . Data Structures: A class library project. Contains the Data Structures implementations. @abstr_number . UnitTest: Unit-testing project for the Algorithms and Data Structures.

#### Requirements:

@abstr_number . .NET Core >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number @abstr_number . XUnit

#### A Note to Contributors:

If you wish to contribute to C# ALGORITHMS, then please make sure you check out the Contribution Guidelines first.

Note: The projects where tested with Visual Studio Community using .NET Core @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number on OSX @abstr_number .
