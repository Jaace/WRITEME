## Downloads

There are @abstr_hyperlink available, built from the release targets. If you just want to use the program and you ended up here, this is what you want :).

It's recommended that if you're new you start with the stable builds. Nightly builds are available every day from the @abstr_hyperlink if you need it, but correspondingly may be less stable.

## Documentation

The text documentation is available @abstr_hyperlink , as well as in @abstr_hyperlink in any build. It's built from restructured text with sphinx.

As mentioned above there are some @abstr_hyperlink showing the use of some basic features and an introduction/overview.

There is also a great presentation by @abstr_hyperlink which goes into some details of how RenderDoc can be used in real world situations: @abstr_hyperlink .
