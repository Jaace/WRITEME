# Karabiner-Elements

Karabiner-Elements is a powerful utility for keyboard customization on macOS Sierra or later.

@abstr_hyperlink stopped working because of the keyboard driver architecture changes at macOS Sierra. Thus, Karabiner-Elements was made from scratch for new macOS.

## Project Status

Karabiner-Elements is ready to use today. It provides a useful subset of Karabiner's features that you can begin using immediately.

You can download the latest Karabiner-Elements from @abstr_hyperlink

@abstr_code_section 

### Step @abstr_number : Building a package

@abstr_code_section 

The `make` script will create a redistributable **Karabiner-Elements-VERSION.dmg** in the current directory.

### Note: About pre-built binaries in the source tree

Karabiner-Elements uses some pre-built binaries in the source tree.

  * `src/vendor/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice/dist/*.kext`
  * `src/vendor/Sparkle/Sparkle.framework`



Above `make package` command does not rebuild these binaries.  
(These binaries will be copied in the distributed package.)

If you want to rebuild these binaries, you have to build them manually.  
Please follow the instruction of these projects.

#### About rebuilding kext in Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice

If you want to build kext in Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice, macOS requires a valid certificate which be able to sign the built kext.  
Unless such certificate, macOS refuses to load the built kext.  
Please read a documentation about @abstr_hyperlink for more details.

(We are including the pre-built kext binary to avoid the restriction that macOS requires a uncommon certificate.)
