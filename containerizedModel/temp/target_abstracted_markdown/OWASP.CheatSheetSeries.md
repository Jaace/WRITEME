# Core team

**Any GitHub member is free to add a comment on any Proposal (issue) or PR.**

However, we have created an official core team (core commiters) in order to: * Review all PR/Proposal in a consistent/regular way using @abstr_hyperlink . * Extend the field of technologies known by the review team. * Allow several technical opinions on a Proposal/PR, all exchanges are public because we use the GitHub comment feature.

Decision of the core team have the same weight than the projet leaders, so, if a core team member reject a PR ( _rejection must be technically documented and explained_ ) then project leaders will apply the global decision.

# PR usage for core commiters

For the following kind of modifications, the PR system will be used by the core commiters in order to allow peer review using the GitHub PR review system: * Addition of a new cheat sheet. * Deep modification of an existing cheat sheet.

Below are the steps to properly submit a PR: @abstr_number . Clone the project. @abstr_number . Move on to the `master` branch: 

> `git checkout master` @abstr_number . Ensure that you have the latest files: `git pull` @abstr_number . Create a branch named `CSS-[ID]` where **[ID]** is the number of the linked issue opened prior to the PR to follow the contribution process: `git checkout -b CSS-[ID]` @abstr_number . Switch to this new branch (normally it's already the case): `git checkout CSS-[ID]` @abstr_number . Do the expected work. @abstr_number . Push the new branch: `git push origin CSS-[ID]`   
>  @abstr_number . When the work is ready for the review, create a pull request by visiting this link: `https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/pull/new/CSS-[ID]` @abstr_number . Implement the modifications requested by the reviewers. Once the reviewers approve the PR, it is then merged to the `master` branch. @abstr_number . Once merged, delete the branch using this @abstr_hyperlink .

# Project logo

Project's official logo files are hosted @abstr_hyperlink .

# Folders

**cheatsheets_excluded** : * Contains the cheat sheets markdown files converted with PANDOC and for which a discussion must be made in order to decide if we include them into the V @abstr_number of the project due to the content has not been updated since a long time or is not relevant anymore. See this @abstr_hyperlink . 

**cheatsheets** : * Contains the final cheat sheets files. * Any `.md` file present into this folder is considered released.

**assets** : * Contains the assets used by the cheat sheets (images, pdf, zip...). * Naming convention is `[CHEAT_CHEET_MARKDOWN_FILE_NAME]_[IDENTIFIER].[EXTENSION]` * Use `PNG` format for the images.

**scripts** : * Contains all the utility scripts used to operate the project (markdown linter audit, dead link identification...). 

**templates** : * Contains templates used for different kinds of files (cheatsheet...).

**.github** : * Contains materials used to configure different behaviors of GitHub.

**.circleci** / **.travis.yml** (file): * Contains the definition of the integration jobs used to control the integrity and consistency of the whole project: * **@abstr_hyperlink** is used to perform compliance check actions at each Push/Pull Request. **It must be/stay the fastest possible** (currently inferior to @abstr_number minutes) in order to provide a rapid compliance feedback about the Push/Pull Request. * **@abstr_hyperlink** is used to perform operations taking _longer time_ like build, publish and deploy actions.

# Offline website

Unfortunately, a PDF file generation is not possible because the content is cut in some cheat sheets like for example the abuse case one.

However, to propose the possibility the consult, in a full offline mode, the collection of all cheat sheets, a script to generate a offline site using @abstr_hyperlink has been created. The script is here.

  * **book.json** : Gitbook configuration file.
  * **Preface.md** : Project preface description applied on the generated site.



## Automated build
