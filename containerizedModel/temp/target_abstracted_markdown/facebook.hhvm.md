HHVM is an open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in @abstr_hyperlink . HHVM uses a just-in-time (JIT) compilation approach to achieve superior performance while maintaining the development flexibility that PHP provides.

HHVM is intended for @abstr_hyperlink projects, and also supports a large subset of PHP @abstr_number that is required by common tools and libraries. We no longer recommend using HHVM for purely PHP projects.

HHVM should be used together with a webserver like the built in, easy to deploy @abstr_hyperlink , or a @abstr_hyperlink -based webserver on top of nginx or Apache.
