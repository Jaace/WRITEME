Welcome to the PaddlePaddle GitHub.

PaddlePaddle (PArallel Distributed Deep LEarning) is an easy-to-use, efficient, flexible and scalable deep learning platform, which is originally developed by Baidu scientists and engineers for the purpose of applying deep learning to many products at Baidu.

Our vision is to enable deep learning for everyone via PaddlePaddle. Please refer to our @abstr_hyperlink to track the latest feature of PaddlePaddle.

### Latest PaddlePaddle Release: @abstr_hyperlink 

### Install Latest Stable Release:

@abstr_code_section Now our developers could acquire Tesla V @abstr_number online computing resources for free. If you create a program by AI Studio, you would obtain @abstr_number hours to train models online per day. If you could insist on that for five consecutive days, then you would own extra @abstr_number hours. @abstr_hyperlink .

## Features

  * **Flexibility**

PaddlePaddle supports a wide range of neural network architectures and optimization algorithms. It is easy to configure complex models such as neural machine translation model with attention mechanism or complex memory connection.

  * **Efficiency**

In order to unleash the power of heterogeneous computing resource, optimization occurs at different levels of PaddlePaddle, including computing, memory, architecture and communication. The following are some examples:

    * Optimized math operations through SSE/AVX intrinsics, BLAS libraries (e.g. MKL, OpenBLAS, cuBLAS) or customized CPU/GPU kernels.
    * Optimized CNN networks through MKL-DNN library.
    * Highly optimized recurrent networks which can handle **variable-length** sequence without padding.
    * Optimized local and distributed training for models with high dimensional sparse data.
  * **Scalability**

With PaddlePaddle, it is easy to use many CPUs/GPUs and machines to speed up your training. PaddlePaddle can achieve high throughput and performance via optimized communication.

  * **Connected to Products**

In addition, PaddlePaddle is also designed to be easily deployable. At Baidu, PaddlePaddle has been deployed into products and services with a vast number of users, including ad click-through rate (CTR) prediction, large-scale image classification, optical character recognition(OCR), search ranking, computer virus detection, recommendation, etc. It is widely utilized in products at Baidu and it has achieved a significant impact. We hope you can also explore the capability of PaddlePaddle to make an impact on your product.
