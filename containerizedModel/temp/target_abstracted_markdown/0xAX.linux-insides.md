# linux-insides

A book-in-progress about the linux kernel and its insides.

**The goal is simple** \- to share my modest knowledge about the insides of the linux kernel and help people who are interested in linux kernel insides, and other low-level subject matter. Feel free to go through the book @abstr_hyperlink
