## Introduction

TrinityCore is a _MMORPG_ Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from _MaNGOS_ , the _Massive Network Game Object Server_ , and is based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
