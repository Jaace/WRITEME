Welcome to Kodi Home Theater Software! 

Kodi is an award-winning **free and open source** software media player and entertainment hub for digital media. Available as a native application for **Android, Linux, BSD, macOS, iOS, and Windows operating systems** , Kodi runs on most common processor architectures.

Created in @abstr_number by a group of like minded programmers, Kodi is a non-profit project run by the XBMC Foundation and developed by volunteers located around the world. More than @abstr_number software developers have contributed to Kodi to date, and @abstr_number -plus translators have worked to expand its reach, making it available in more than @abstr_number languages.

While Kodi functions very well as a standard media player application for your computer, it has been designed to be the perfect companion for your HTPC. With its **beautiful interface and powerful skinning engine** , Kodi feels very natural to use from the couch with a remote control and is the ideal solution for your home theater.

## Give your media the love it deserves

Kodi can be used to play almost all popular audio and video formats around. It was designed for network playback, so you can stream your multimedia from anywhere in the house or directly from the internet using practically any protocol available.

Point Kodi to your media and watch it **scan and automagically create a personalized library** complete with box covers, descriptions, and fanart. There are playlist and slideshow functions, a weather forecast feature and many audio visualizations. Once installed, your computer or HTPC will become a fully functional multimedia jukebox.
