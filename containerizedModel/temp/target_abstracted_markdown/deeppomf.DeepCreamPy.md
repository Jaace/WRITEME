A deep learning-based tool to automatically replace censored artwork in hentai with plausible reconstructions.

The user colors censored regions green in an image editing program like GIMP or Photoshop. A neural network fills in the censored regions.

DeepCreamPy has a pre-built binary for Windows @abstr_number -bit available @abstr_hyperlink . DeepCreamPy's code works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Please before you open a new issue check @abstr_hyperlink and check the @abstr_hyperlink .

## Features

  * Decensoring images of ANY size
  * Decensoring of ANY shaped censor (e.g. black lines, pink hearts, etc.)
  * Higher quality decensors
  * Support for mosaic decensors (WIP)



## Limitations

The decensorship is for color hentai images that have minor to moderate censorship of the penis or vagina. If a vagina or penis is completely censored out, decensoring will be ineffective.

It does NOT work with: \- Black and white/Monochrome image \- Hentai with screentones (e.g. printed hentai) \- Real life porn \- Censorship of nipples \- Censorship of anus \- Animated gifs/videos
