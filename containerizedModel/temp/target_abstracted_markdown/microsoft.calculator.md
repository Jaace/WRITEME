## Roadmap

## Diagnostic Data

This project collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services. Read our @abstr_hyperlink to learn more. Diagnostic data is disabled in development builds by default, and can be enabled with the `SEND_DIAGNOSTICS` build flag.

## Currency Converter

Windows Calculator includes a currency converter feature that uses mock data in developer builds. The data that Microsoft uses for the currency converter feature (e.g., in the retail version of the application) is not licensed for your use. The mock data will be clearly identifiable as it references planets instead of countries, and remains static regardless of selected inputs.

## Reporting Security Issues

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at < @abstr_hyperlink >. You should receive a response within @abstr_number hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the @abstr_hyperlink key, can be found in the @abstr_hyperlink .
