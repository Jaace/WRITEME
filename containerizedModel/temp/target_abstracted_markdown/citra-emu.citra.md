# Citra

@abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_hyperlink 

Citra is an experimental open-source Nintendo @abstr_number DS emulator/debugger written in C++. It is written with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows, Linux and macOS.

Citra emulates a subset of @abstr_number DS hardware and therefore is useful for running/debugging homebrew applications, and it is also able to run many commercial games! Some of these do not run at a playable state, but we are working every day to advance the project forward. (Playable here means compatibility of at least "Okay" on our @abstr_hyperlink .)

Citra is licensed under the GPLv @abstr_number (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included. Please read the @abstr_hyperlink before getting started with the project.

Check out our @abstr_hyperlink !

For development discussion, please join us at #citra-dev on freenode.

### Development

Most of the development happens on GitHub. It's also where @abstr_hyperlink is hosted.

If you want to contribute please take a look at the @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink . You should as well contact any of the developers in the forum in order to know about the current state of the emulator because the @abstr_hyperlink isn't maintained anymore.

If you want to contribute to the user interface translation, please checkout @abstr_hyperlink . We centralize the translation work there, and periodically upstream translation.

### Building

  * __Windows__: @abstr_hyperlink 
  * __Linux__: @abstr_hyperlink 
  * __macOS__: @abstr_hyperlink 



### Support

We happily accept monetary donations or donated games and hardware. Please see our @abstr_hyperlink for more information on how you can contribute to Citra. Any donations received will go towards things like: * @abstr_number DS consoles for developers to explore the hardware * @abstr_number DS games for testing * Any equipment required for homebrew * Infrastructure setup * Eventually @abstr_number D displays to get proper @abstr_number D output working

We also more than gladly accept used @abstr_number DS consoles, preferably ones with firmware @abstr_number . @abstr_number or lower! If you would like to give yours away, don't hesitate to join our IRC channel #citra on @abstr_hyperlink and talk to neobrain or bunnei. Mind you, IRC is slow-paced, so it might be a while until people reply. If you're in a hurry you can just leave contact details in the channel or via private message and we'll get back to you.
