PCSX @abstr_number is a free and open-source PlayStation @abstr_number (PS @abstr_number ) emulator. Its purpose is to emulate the PS @abstr_number 's hardware, using a combination of MIPS CPU @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink and a @abstr_hyperlink which manages hardware states and PS @abstr_number system memory. This allows you to play PS @abstr_number games on your PC, with many additional features and benefits.

# Project Details

The PCSX @abstr_number project has been running for more than ten years. Past versions could only run a few public domain game demos, but newer versions can run many games at full speed, including popular titles such as Final Fantasy X and Devil May Cry @abstr_number . Visit the @abstr_hyperlink to check the latest compatibility status of games (with more than @abstr_number titles tested), or ask for help in the @abstr_hyperlink .

The latest officially released stable version is version @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number .

Installers and binaries for both Windows and Linux are available from @abstr_hyperlink .

Development builds are also available from @abstr_hyperlink .

# System Requirements

## Minimum

  * OS: Windows @abstr_number or GNU/Linux
  * CPU: Any that supports SSE @abstr_number @ @abstr_number STR
  * GPU: DirectX @abstr_number support
  * RAM: @abstr_number GB



## Recommended

  * OS: Windows @abstr_number ( @abstr_number -bit) or GNU/Linux ( @abstr_number -bit)
  * CPU: Any that supports AVX @abstr_number (Core series Haswell or Ryzen and newer) @ @abstr_number STR or better
  * GPU: DirectX @abstr_number support or better
  * RAM: @abstr_number GB or more



## Notes

  * You need the @abstr_hyperlink for this version to work.   
Note: Visual C++ @abstr_number is directly compatible with Visual C++ @abstr_number . While the project is built with Visual C++ @abstr_number , either version will work.

  * PCSX @abstr_number @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number is the last stable version to support Windows XP and Direct @abstr_number D @abstr_number . Windows XP is no longer getting updates (including security-related updates), and graphics drivers for Windows XP are older and no longer maintained.

  * Make sure to update your operating system, drivers, and DirectX (if applicable) to ensure you have the best experience possible. Having a newer GPU is also recommended so you have the latest supported drivers.

  * Because of copyright issues, and the complexity of trying to work around it, you need a BIOS dump extracted from a legitimately-owned PS @abstr_number console to use the emulator. For more information about the BIOS and how to get it from your console, visit @abstr_hyperlink .

  * PCSX @abstr_number mainly takes advantage of @abstr_number CPU cores. As of @abstr_hyperlink PCSX @abstr_number can now take advantage of more than @abstr_number cores using the MTVU speedhack. This can be a significant speedup on CPUs with @abstr_number + cores, but it may be a slowdown on GS-limited games (or on CPUs with fewer than @abstr_number cores).

  * Requirements benchmarks are based on a statistic from the Passmark CPU bench marking software. When we say "STR", we are referring to Passmark's "Single Thread Rating" statistic. You can look up your CPU on https://cpubenchmark.net to see how it compares to PCSX @abstr_number 's requirements.
