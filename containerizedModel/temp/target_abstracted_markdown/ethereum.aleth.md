## Usage

The Ethereum Documentation site hosts the **@abstr_hyperlink** , which has a Quick Start section.

Operating system | Status \---------------- | ---------- Ubuntu and macOS | @abstr_hyperlink Windows | @abstr_hyperlink 

## Install

### Download release binaries

https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/releases

### Using docker images

Aleth: @abstr_code_section 

Testeth: @abstr_code_section 

### Building from source

#### Get the source code

Git and GitHub are used to maintain the source code. Clone the repository by:

@abstr_code_section 

The `--recursive` option is important. It orders git to clone additional submodules to build the project. If you missed `--recursive` option, you are able to correct your mistake with command `git submodule update --init`.

#### Install CMake

CMake is used to control the build configuration of the project. Latest version of CMake is required (at the time of writing @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number is the minimum). We strongly recommend you to install CMake by downloading and unpacking the binary distribution of the latest version available on the @abstr_hyperlink .

The CMake package available in your operating system can also be installed and used if it meets the minimum version requirement.

> **Alternative method**
> 
> The repository contains the scripts/install_cmake.sh script that downloads a fixed version of CMake and unpacks it to the given directory prefix. Example usage: `scripts/install_cmake.sh --prefix /usr/local`.

#### Build

Configure the project build with the following command to create the `build` directory with the configuration.

@abstr_code_section 

On **Windows** Visual Studio @abstr_number is required. You should generate Visual Studio solution file (.sln) for @abstr_number -bit architecture by adding `-G "Visual Studio @abstr_number @abstr_number Win @abstr_number "` argument to the CMake configure command. After configuration is completed, the `aleth.sln` can be found in the `build` directory.

#### Common Issues Building on Windows

##### LINK : fatal error LNK @abstr_number : cannot run 'rc.exe'

Rc.exe is the @abstr_hyperlink . It's distributed with the @abstr_hyperlink and is required for generating the Visual Studio solution file. It can be found in the following directory: ```%ProgramFiles(x @abstr_number )%\Windows Kits\\bin\\\ @abstr_code_section NAME: aleth @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number USAGE: aleth [options]

Used for testing purposes. \--peerset  Comma delimited list of peers; element format: type:enode://publickey@ipAddress[:port[?discport=port]] Types: default Attempt connection when no other peers are available and pinning is disabled required Keep connected at all times
    
    
                                          Ports:
                                          The first port argument is the tcp port used for direct communication among peers. If the second port
                                          argument isn't supplied, the first port argument will also be the udp port used for node discovery.
                                          If neither the first nor second port arguments are supplied, a default port of  @abstr_number  will be used for
                                          both peer communication and node discovery.

## Mining

This project is **not suitable for Ethereum mining** because the support for GPU mining has been dropped some time ago including the ethminer tool. Use the ethminer tool from https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.

## Testing

Details on how to run and debug the tests can be found here
