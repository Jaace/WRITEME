# LiveCharts @abstr_number . @abstr_number is coming soon (ETA ~~April~~ September @abstr_number )!

We are doing a full rewrite of the library with all the learned lessons, the new version is focused on:

  * **If you own the Geared package** the new high performance version is already yours! thank you very much for all your support!

  * **Portability** : In version @abstr_number .x it was hard keep WPF, UWP and Winforms versions up to date, in the new version we extracted all the math to a dotnet core project, then we are working on @abstr_number different platfomrs WPF, Xamarin, UWP and the new high performance package.

  * **Performance** : when the library started, performance was not the target, as the library community grow, the Geared package was released (the current high performance version), and it works for many cases, but we want LiveCharts to be the fastest library out there, in the new high performance package we are scaping from WPF performance limitations and drawing everything using DirectX with the well know @abstr_hyperlink package.
  * _* @abstr_number d_ *: @abstr_number .x layout was not designed to draw @abstr_number d plots, version @abstr_number . @abstr_number is really flexible and lucky we will be on @abstr_number d soon.
  * **Keep it easy!** : Even somethings might change, the idea of the library is the same, we only want to add support for the missing features and/or a better code quality so we can fix issues faster for all the platforms, all the samples will be updated with the new version.

### it is also

# Simple, Interactive

As easy as manipulating any generic list in .Net, LiveCharts updates and animates as your data changes in real time, charts are also sensitive to size changes.

# Powerful

LiveCharts is not just beauty charts, this example contains @abstr_number , @abstr_number points, and the chart is being refreshed constantly, we support zooming, panning, multiple axes, sections, merged UIelemnts and much more!
