### What is AutoMapper?

AutoMapper is a simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another. This type of code is rather dreary and boring to write, so why not invent a tool to do it for us?

This is the main repository for AutoMapper, but there's more:

  * @abstr_hyperlink 
  * @abstr_hyperlink 
  * @abstr_hyperlink 
  * @abstr_hyperlink 
  * @abstr_hyperlink 



### How do I get started?

First, configure AutoMapper to know what types you want to map, in the startup of your application:

@abstr_code_section Then in your application code, execute the mappings:

@abstr_code_section 

Check out the @abstr_hyperlink . When you're done there, the @abstr_hyperlink goes in to the nitty-gritty details. If you have questions, you can post them to @abstr_hyperlink or in our @abstr_hyperlink .

### Where can I get it?

First, @abstr_hyperlink . Then, install @abstr_hyperlink from the package manager console:

@abstr_code_section 

### Do you have an issue?

First check if it's already fixed by trying the @abstr_hyperlink .

You might want to know exactly what @abstr_hyperlink at runtime.

If you're still running into problems, file an issue above.
