## About ConEmu

@abstr_hyperlink is a Windows console emulator with tabs, which represents multiple consoles as one customizable GUI window with various features.

Initially, the program was created as a companion to @abstr_hyperlink , my favorite shell replacement - file and archive management, command history and completion, powerful editor.

Today, ConEmu can be used with any other console application or simple GUI tools (like PuTTY for example). ConEmu is an active project, open to @abstr_hyperlink .
