**@abstr_hyperlink**

NSwag is a Swagger/OpenAPI @abstr_number . @abstr_number and @abstr_number . @abstr_number toolchain for .NET, .NET Core, Web API, ASP.NET Core, TypeScript (jQuery, AngularJS, Angular @abstr_number +, Aurelia, KnockoutJS and more) and other platforms, written in C#. The @abstr_hyperlink uses JSON and JSON Schema to describe a RESTful web API. The NSwag project provides tools to generate OpenAPI specifications from existing ASP.NET Web API controllers and client code from these OpenAPI specifications. 

The project combines the functionality of Swashbuckle (OpenAPI/Swagger generation) and AutoRest (client generation) in one toolchain. This way a lot of incompatibilites can be avoided and features which are not well described by the OpenAPI specification or JSON Schema are better supported (e.g. @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink and reference handling). The NSwag project heavily uses @abstr_hyperlink for JSON Schema handling and C#/TypeScript class/interface generation.

The project is developed and maintained by @abstr_hyperlink and other contributors.

**Features:**

  * @abstr_hyperlink 
  * Serve the specs via ASP.NET (Core) middleware, optionally with @abstr_hyperlink or @abstr_hyperlink 
  * Generate C# or TypeScript clients/proxies from these specs
  * Everything can be automated via CLI (distributed via NuGet tool or build target; or NPM)
  * CLI configured via JSON file or NSwagStudio Windows UI



**Ways to use the toolchain:**

  * Simple to use Windows GUI, @abstr_hyperlink 
  * By using the @abstr_hyperlink (also serves the @abstr_hyperlink ) (recommended)
  * Via @abstr_hyperlink (Windows, Mac and Linux support through @abstr_hyperlink or .NET Core console binary, also via @abstr_hyperlink )
  * In your C# code, via @abstr_hyperlink 
  * In your @abstr_hyperlink 
  * With @abstr_hyperlink tags in your .csproj (preview)
  * In your @abstr_hyperlink (external project, might not use latest NSwag version)

### Usage in C&# @abstr_number ;

To register the @abstr_hyperlink to generate a OpenAPI spec and render the UI, register NSwag in `Startup.cs`: 

@abstr_code_section 

The following code shows how to read an OpenAPI/Swagger specification and generate C# client classes to call the described web services:
