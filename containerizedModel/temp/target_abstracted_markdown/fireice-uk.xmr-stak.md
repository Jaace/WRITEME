## Download

You can find the latest releases and precompiled binaries on GitHub under @abstr_hyperlink .

## Default Developer Donation

By default, the miner will donate @abstr_number % of the hashpower ( @abstr_number minutes in @abstr_number minutes) to my pool. If you want to change that, edit donate-level.hpp before you build the binaries.
