@abstr_image 

## By developers and for developers

I am an iOS developer and currently learning Swift.

This project is inspired by @abstr_hyperlink 's @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink 's @abstr_hyperlink .

**This repo does not merely follow tutorials, I re-build them with better code style and architecture design.**

For code style, I strictly follow @abstr_hyperlink ;

For developers, I have a README file and screenshots for every single project, you can start coding from there.

## What's next?

I will maintain the project with latest syntax and most advanced code style. More code comments are going to be covered as well.

Also, **unit tests** will be added to ensure the quality of the codebase.
