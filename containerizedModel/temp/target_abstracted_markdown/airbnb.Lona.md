## Overview

@abstr_hyperlink 

Lona is a collection of tools for building design systems and using them to generate cross-platform UI code, Sketch files, and other artifacts.

Lona consists primarily of @abstr_number parts:

  * Lona Components - A data format, `.component`, for cross-platform components
  * Lona Studio - A GUI tool for designing `.component` files
  * Lona Compiler - A CLI tool & API for generating UI code from `.component` files



Why Lona? Read more about challenges with cross-platform design systems at scale, and how Lona solves them here.

### Lona Components

A design system is defined in JSON as a collection of:

  * Components (can be nested)
  * Colors, Text Styles, Gradients, and Shadows
  * Data Types



The specification for these files can be found in the docs.

### Lona Studio

Lona Studio provides a graphical interface for working with `.component` files.

Lona Studio is primarily for building component systems, but can also be used for:

  * Quickly mocking up new screens from existing components
  * Viewing designs with real data from JSON files or APIs
  * Experimenting with designs across multiple screen sizes
  * Automating design tasks - e.g. localizing screenshots for different languages and exporting hundreds of images
  * Working with animations (Lottie) and rendering videos from them
  * and more!



If you have Xcode installed, you can try it out by following the installation instructions.

> Wondering if this replaces Sketch? Why a native Mac App? I answer some common questions here in the FAQ.

### Lona Compiler

The Lona Compiler converts .component files to UI code for various targets.

Currently, these targets are supported:

  * iOS / macOS (Swift)
  * React DOM / React Native / React Sketchapp (JavaScript)



Support is planned for:

  * Android (Kotlin)



The target with the most features currently is Swift. However, it's still fairly rough. If you want to try it out, check out the installation instructions.
