LiteDB is a small, fast and lightweight NoSQL embedded database. 

  * Serverless NoSQL Document Store
  * Simple API similar to MongoDB
  * @abstr_number % C# code for .NET @abstr_number . @abstr_number / NETStandard @abstr_number . @abstr_number in a single DLL (less than @abstr_number kb)
  * Thread safe
  * ACID with full transaction support
  * Data recovery after write failure (WAL log file)
  * Datafile encryption using DES (AES) cryptography
  * Map your POCO classes to `BsonDocument` using attributes or fluent mapper API
  * Store files and stream data (like GridFS in MongoDB)
  * Single data file storage (like SQLite)
  * Index document fields for fast search (up to @abstr_number indexes per collection)
  * LINQ support for queries
  * SQL-Like commands to access/transform data
  * LiteDB Studio - Nice UI for data access
  * Pretty fast - @abstr_hyperlink 
  * Open source and free for everyone - including commercial use

## How to use LiteDB

A quick example for storing and searching documents:

```C# // Create your POCO class public class Customer { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public int Age { get; set; } public string[] Phones { get; set; } public bool IsActive { get; set; } }

// Open database (or create if doesn't exist) using(var db = new LiteDatabase(@"MyData.db")) { // Get customer collection var col = db.GetCollection("customers");
    
    
    // Create your new customer instance
    var customer = new Customer
    { 
        Name = "John Doe", 
        Phones = new string[] { " @abstr_number - @abstr_number ", " @abstr_number - @abstr_number " }, 
        Age =  @abstr_number ,
        IsActive = true
    };
    
    // Create unique index in Name field
    col.EnsureIndex(x => x.Name, true);
    
    // Insert new customer document (Id will be auto-incremented)
    col.Insert(customer);
    
    // Update a document inside a collection
    customer.Name = "Joana Doe";
    
    col.Update(customer);
    
    // Use LINQ to query documents (with no index)
    var results = col.Find(x => x.Age >  @abstr_number );
    

} @abstr_code_section C# // DbRef to cross references public class Order { public ObjectId Id { get; set; } public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; } public Address ShippingAddress { get; set; } public Customer Customer { get; set; } public List Products { get; set; } } 

// Re-use mapper from global instance var mapper = BsonMapper.Global;

// "Produts" and "Customer" are from other collections (not embedded document) mapper.Entity() .DbRef(x => x.Customer, "customers") // @abstr_number to @abstr_number / @abstr_number reference .DbRef(x => x.Products, "products") // @abstr_number to Many reference .Field(x => x.ShippingAddress, "addr"); // Embedded sub document

using(var db = new LiteDatabase("MyOrderDatafile.db")) { var orders = db.GetCollection("orders");
    
    
    // When query Order, includes references
    var query = orders
        .Include(x => x.Customer)
        .Include(x => x.Products) //  @abstr_number  to many reference
        .Find(x => x.OrderDate <= DateTime.Now);
    
    // Each instance of Order will load Customer/Products references
    foreach(var order in query)
    {
        var name = order.Customer.Name;
        ...
    }
    

}

```
