_The missing Spotlight plugin system_

_Das fehlende Plugin-System fÃ¼r Spotlight._

@abstr_image 

Flashlight is an **unofficial Spotlight API** that allows you to programmatically process queries and add additional results. It's _very rough right now,_ and a _horrendous hack_ , but a fun proof of concept.

_Have an idea for a plugin?_ @abstr_hyperlink 

**Installation**

Clone and build using Xcode, or @abstr_hyperlink .

## Writing Plugins

**Start with the @abstr_hyperlink .**

Once you're finished with a plugin, clone our repo, place your bundle in `PluginDirectories/ @abstr_number`, and we'll upload it to the online directory.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions to the Flashlight core and plugins. See @abstr_hyperlink for more info.
