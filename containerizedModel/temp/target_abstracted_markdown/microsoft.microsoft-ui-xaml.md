## WinUI features

### Benefits

The WinUI Library provides some useful benefits when building apps for Windows @abstr_number :

@abstr_number . **Helps you stay up to date**   
WinUI helps keep your app up to date with the latest versions of key controls and features of @abstr_hyperlink and the @abstr_hyperlink 

@abstr_number . **Provides backward compatibility**   
WinUI is backward-compatible with a wide range of Windows @abstr_number versions: you can start building and shipping apps with new XAML features immediately as soon as they're released, even if your users aren't on the latest version of Windows @abstr_number 

@abstr_number . **Makes it simpler to build version adaptive apps**   
You don't need version checks or conditional XAML markup to use WinUI controls or features: WinUI automatically adapts to the user's OS version

### Version support

The Microsoft.UI.Xaml @abstr_number . @abstr_number NuGet package requires your project to have TargetPlatformVersion >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number and TargetPlatformMinVersion >= @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number when building. 

Your app's users can be on any of the following supported Windows versions: * Windows Insider Previews * May @abstr_number Update ( @abstr_number aka " @abstr_number H @abstr_number ") * October @abstr_number Update ( @abstr_number aka "Redstone @abstr_number ") * April @abstr_number Update ( @abstr_number aka "Redstone @abstr_number ") * Fall Creators Update ( @abstr_number aka "Redstone @abstr_number ") * Creators Update ( @abstr_number aka "Redstone @abstr_number ")

Some features may have a reduced or slightly different user experience on older versions, particularly on builds before @abstr_number . This should not impact overall usability.
