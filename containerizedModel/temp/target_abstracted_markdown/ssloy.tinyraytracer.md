# Understandable RayTracing in @abstr_number lines of bare C++

This repository is a support code for my computer graphics lectures. It is not meant to be the ultimate rendering code or even physically realistic. It is meant to be **simple**. This project is distributed under the @abstr_hyperlink .

**Check @abstr_hyperlink that accompanies the source code. The second raytracing chapter is available @abstr_hyperlink . If you are looking for a software rasterizer, check the @abstr_hyperlink .**

In my lectures I tend to avoid third party libraries as long as it is reasonable, because it forces to understand what is happening under the hood. So, the raytracing @abstr_number lines of plain C++ give us this result: @abstr_image 

## compilation

@abstr_code_section 

You can open the project in Gitpod, a free online dev evironment for GitHub:

@abstr_hyperlink 

On open, the editor will compile & run the program as well as open the resulting image in the editor's preview. Just change the code in the editor and rerun the script (use the terminal's history) to see updated images.
